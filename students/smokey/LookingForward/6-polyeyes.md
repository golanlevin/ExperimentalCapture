PolyEyes 2.0 is an "augmented reality project from the Interactive Architecture Lab is a headset that increases your range of vision around you".

This is an interesting take on augmented reality - first it distorts and adjusts your field of view with the “hammerhead vision system”. Further, thanks to the raspberry pi insides, you are able to share or receive your visual field with others. The goal is to explore alternate ways of communicating. In this regard, I think this project has missed the mark - it doesn’t seem to have explored it’s conceptual ideas on new communication methods - to me it feels that is a retroscripted idea that comes after building the ridiculous hammerhead face-device.
