#Dark 'N Stormy - High Speed Video & High Frequency Audio Capture
###A project by Smokey Dyar and and Miranda Jacoby

 Our aim is to use high-speed video capture to tell a story by breaking the narrative down into brief key moments (drawing from montage editing techniques), as well as exploring how sound can be stretched, distorted, combined, and remapped to match high-speed footage.

Utilizing an Edgertronic high-speed camera and a Zoom H6 audio recorder, we used a series of quick captures to document the mixing of a Dark 'N Stormy at 600 frames per second. We chose drink-mixing as a subject because the sloshing liquid creates an abundance of interesting visual and audio moments. The video also alludes to ultra-high quality television advertisements for drinks, which allows the turn (a spit take) to have more of a visually comedic punch.

We ended up making the drink twice--once to record the video, and again for the audio.

The video was captured at 600 frames per second as faster video capture had diminishing returns on visual appeal ("prettyness") vs. eventuful action per time period. 

The audio was captured at 24 bit 96000hz stereo, a normally so-high-it's absurd quality, to give us the most freedom when stretching and distorting it. 

After capturing our footage, we imported it into Adobe Premiere and applied time-ramping effects to improve visual interest and provide transitory moments. Then, we went in and added the audio which we stretched using [Paul's Extreme Sound Stretch](http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/) so that pitch was maintained.

The audio is rarely the same slow-down factor as the video. A combination of different stretch levels (including unstretched audio) were creatively combined during editing. 

We also did a few captures of Smokey's cat, Agent 86, pouncing at 2500 frames per second. Gifs to arrive shortly.
