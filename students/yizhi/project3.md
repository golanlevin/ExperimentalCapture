####Project 3
## 360 Capture with Drones
####Liz Zhang & Vidya Vinnakota

###The idea
In this project we tried combining a drone with a 360 lens and have it fly straight, up, down, and spin to get the raw footages which we use to edit into a music video.

###Tools
The tools used for this project are a Parrot ARDrone 2.0, and the lens of a sonyBloggie Mhs‑fs1/b 4 Gb Camcorder.

###Process
Video capture

We had to tape the 360 lens onto the drone camera to get the panoramic image without adding extra weight to the drone.

Our selection of places includes mainly corridors and hallways with plenty of space and architechtual details.
The places we visited for this project include but are not limited to:
Dorety Hall Corridors
The Glass Bridge between Wean Hall and Newell-Simons
Wean Hall corridors
Cathedral of Learning

The footage can be unwrapped and shown as below:

For post processing, we wrote our program to get rid of the hole in the 360 video and synthesized it with music.
