Point Cloud Slitscanning
Created 11/15/15 by Michelle Ma

This folder contains the source files for my Point Cloud Slitscanning app in OpenFrameworks.

The program generates slitscanned ply files in X, Y, and Z directions. The frames of your point clouds need to be saved in folders named scene0, scene1, etc. in order to work. After they have been generated once, the app can be used as a viewer and you can toggle between scenes using your keyboard.

You can also save screens of the point clouds by toggling 'p'. It slows down the program significantly though.

If you use these scripts be sure to cite me!

Enjoy.
