# Looking Outwards

### What is a “Looking Outwards” report?

On a number of occasions this semester you will be asked to “look outwards” — to browse various journals, [blogs and feeds](blogs.md) or other resources in order to deepen your knowledge of the field, and familiarize yourself with the current state of the art. You will then be expected to report on your findings, as described below — hopefully, with a critical perspective. Some weeks, the “Looking Outwards” deliverables may be thematically oriented. There is no restriction on the sources of information you may use for a “Looking Outwards” report. For example, you are invited to use the library, particularly to learn about works in journals or older works which may not be well-documented on the Internet.

A “*Looking-Outwards*” report is a one-page document reporting on a project that interests you. Your job is to browse blogs, journals, and/or other sources, and then report on something interesting that you haven’t seen before. Blogging about a project of which you’re already aware defeats the point of the assignment, which is to deepen your familiarity with the fields of new media arts, creative technology, computer science, and visual culture.

Try to find things that you aspire to make yourself. If you’re not finding projects that interest you, ask your professor or someone else for advice; you may just need to find the right search terms.

*Looking Outwards* reports will be due during weeks when there is no project critique. Students should anticipate that they may be asked to discuss their most recent report. 

A [list of new-media arts blogs](blogs.md) has been provided to you as a starting point, but there are many other places to discover interesting work.

### How to do a Looking Outwards report

In a markdown document,

* Embed relevant images and/or link to video documentation of the project, and write a paragraph (~150 words) about the project that interested you. 

In this paragraph, you should:

* Explain the project in a sentence or two (what it is, how it operates, etc.); Explain what inspires you about the project (i.e. what you find interesting or admirable);

* Critique the project: describe how it might have been more effective; discuss some of the intriguing possibilities that it suggests, or opportunities that it missed; explain what you think the creator(s) got right, and how they got it right.

* Research the project’s chain of influences. Check into the bibliography, if there is one; dig up the ‘deep background’, and compare the project with related work or prior art, if appropriate. What sources inspired the creator this project? What was “their” Looking Outwards?

### Learning Outcomes

After completing the sequence of ten *Looking Outwards* reports, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate familiarity with historic and/or contemporary new-media or other projects relevant to that student’s specific research interests;
* Demonstrate familiarity with new-media projects that exemplify cultural practice with widely-used arts-engineering toolkits and/or with specific technologies.
