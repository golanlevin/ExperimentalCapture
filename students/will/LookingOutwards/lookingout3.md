"Box" is a performance piece that explores the intersection of physical and digital space through projection mapping on moving objects. The robotics studio Bot & Dolly repurposed robotic arms normally used for automobile assembly to move two projection screens around in a dance-like way, while projecting ever-changing patterns and shapes onto them. At times, the screens will intersect and seemingly real, larger patterns appear. What I find incredibly inspiring in this piece is the fluidity in which the projections change from seemingly real, floating objects to obviously digital patterns. The line between physical and digital is blurred, and I'm left feeling like anything real or digital could appear in that moment.

I think the creators of this project really succeeded with the interaction of the two screens, giving them separate identities at times, and at other times, a singular, unified identity. The movement of the screens combined with the projections lead the viewer to continually question the realness of what they're seeing, even though they are fully aware that there are physical things (the screens) moving. The user extends the realness of the screen movement to the projected objects, until the objects evolve into abstract patterns and melt into the next one. 

The blending of real and digital could be made more effective by grounding the projected objects in the physical environment, using the actual warehouse where the performance is filmed as the background of the projected object. It would initially give the illusion that the user is looking at a real object, until the real background disappears, leaving only the projected object levitating in space. 

The main influences for this project was interest in the most basic magic tricks - the disappearing coin, dove, tablecloth - as well as a personal interest in optical art. Illusions from these areas were borrowed to create the story and framework in "Box".
