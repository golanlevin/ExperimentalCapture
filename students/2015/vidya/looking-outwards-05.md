###‘Still Life’

I think this piece is quite spectacular. This would be a great idea for our project of a still life in some kind of motion. I think the process of this piece is as impactful as the whole piece at the end. Its so cool that at first when you see the piece they are completely inanimate objects, but a small tilt of the frame brings in so much reality and physics to the work. This piece was made in unity and unity has many interactive options. We used unity as well for our interactive hologram and this piece just steps it up and creates a clear balance between an object in motion and its still life.
