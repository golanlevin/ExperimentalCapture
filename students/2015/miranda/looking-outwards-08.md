Audio Landscape is a project by Dan Neame that creates geometric music visualizations from the stereo frequency data of a given .mp3 file. It also conveniently runs in browsers with native browser support for HTML5 Audio and WebGL (So basically recent releases of Firefox and Chrome). 

There are three visualizations: Green hills, Volcano, and Vapor. Green hills is a mountain range that rises out of the sea, Volcano follows a lava flow through a pulsing rocky plain, and Vapor is a neon valley. Each comes with their own pre-loaded soundtrack, but one can drag and drop in an .mp3 file to generate new terrain. As the music plays, a camera flies over the terrain as its generated. 

I especially enjoy the details in Green hills, such as the gradient that goes from sandy yellow to grassy green to snow capped white depending on the mountain's height, in addition to the periodic trees. I appreciate that the camera movement is incredibly smooth, and only flies through geometry if you put in a file with quickly fluctuating frequencies.

While additional visual elements might make for longer load times, I'd like to see more details added to the Green hills scene, such as tree variations or a splashing visual effect where the mountain rises from the sea. (These are just nitpicks with the intent of creating greater variety inside the audio visualization.) Audio Landscape is a conceptually cool and robust project. It can certainly be taken further, but it's awesome as is.
