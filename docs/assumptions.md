# Assumptions to Question

> *In this course in "Experimental Capture", we aim to understand the words "photograph" and "camera" in the broadest possible sense.* 

We aim to *question the basic assumptions of camera-based imaging*, as we generally understand it today. In this course, we will interrogate and test underlying assumptions, such as the premise that:

* **a photo shows a scene from only one moment**
* **a photo shows a scene from only one point of view**
* **a photo's exposure is nearly instantaneous**
* **a photo is viewable (developed) immediately**
* **a camera is small enough to be handheld**
* **a camera is large enough to see with the naked eye**  
* **a photo has a fixed focal plane**
* **a photo is produced in only one sitting**
* **a photo persists longer than its subject.**
* **a photo has linear perspective**
* **a photo documents light frequencies similar to those perceived by human vision.** 
	* *But what if a photo recorded or transduced electromagnetic phenomena beyond our perception, such as ultraviolet, near infrared, thermal (deep infrared), or x-rays?*
* **a photo is someone's decisive construction.** 
	* *But what if a photo were more like the result of a query into a database? Or something triggered by an algorithm?*
* **a photo only shows the external surfaces of things.** 
	* *But what if a photo showed the internal structure of its subject?*
* **a photograph is comprised of a uniform rectangular grid of pixels**
* **a photo has homogeneous information density everywhere (not foveal)**
* **a photo is taken with a camera which you 'own' and over which you have physical control** (found cameras)
* **a photo is a static media object.** (It could be playable, like a game)
* **a photo is is rectangular**
