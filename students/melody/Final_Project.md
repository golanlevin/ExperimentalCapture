**Leftovers from Halloween**

My final project consists of turning my first project into an interactive environment, compatible with the Oculus. The story behind this piece is inspired by my friend's memory of sifting through Halloween candy as a child and seeing the unwanted Almond Joy bars left at the bottom.

*Process*

The Almond Joy is modeled in Agisoft Photoscan, the pumpkin and environment composed in Unity3D. The program is particularly appropriate for this project as I was able to treat the piece as first-person game, in which the viewer can control his/her movements on a desktop with the key pad (and views with the mouse), or wth the Oculus.

In retrospect, I would have chosen a different environment for the pumpkin, as I realize now that a kitchen generally receives a lot of traffic and thus doesn't quite fit the theme of loneliness and lost-ness. If I were to remake the environment, I would probably choose a space under the bed where it feels more neglected, or in a closet.
