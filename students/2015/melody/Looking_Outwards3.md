**Zoetrope Cake 'Melting Pop'**

(From Wikipedia) A zoetrope is a pre-film animation device that mimics movement by quickly playing in sequence a series of images in rapid succession. Usually the zoetrope resembles a hollow cylinder with vertical slits in the sides and an image wrapped around in the interior with the images facing inwards. As the zoetrope is spun, viewers can witness the "animation" through the slits in the sides.
(From 'This is Colossal')
French director Alexandre Dubosc's chocolate reinterpretation of the vintage Zoetrope takes the form of a chocolate three-tiered cake that achieves the same affect bu in 3d. Each tier of the cake features a different 'gif', whether it is a popcorn kernel popping or a series of pacmen consuming corn kernels. Each sequence of the image is meticulously rendered and only slightly modified from its previous image such that the rapid movement rotates through the sequence smoothly and creates the illusion of continuous movement.

The most impressive part of the piece for me was how well each individual panel tied together collectively. From the 'flames' popping the popcorn to the little faces consuming each kernel, the entire cake is a composition of small, fluid animations.
Due to the size of the cake, the video in itself appears to be a a sped-up stop-motion capture in which the cake was painstakingly rotated at minute angles in photographs that were then played back quickly in succession, further mimicking the zoetrope.
