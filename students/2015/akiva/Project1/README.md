# Old Cube

When I was in fifth grade a got a Rubik's Cube. After many many hours and years of use this cube has a vast amount of history embedded in it's form. For this project I brought this physical object into the digital world. Because this cube is located in my childhood home on the other side of the country, I used a camera, Google Hangouts, and my dad to capture about 100 images of the cube. Working over Hangouts to direct my parent taking very specific photos was a very interesting experience and defiantly put in to perspective how easy taking a photo with my own hands is. Once I had captured these photos I used PhotoScan to create a high detail 3D model and texture. Finally I brought this model in to Unity 3D and created a digital simulation of the Rubik's Cube mechanism.

I find this project interesting because once the application is uploaded to the internet, anyone in the world will be able to use a toy that I personally had as a child. The way that they use it will be vastly different from the way that I did. On the surface all the my physical use is shown, where as there will be no distress caused by users of the digital cube.
