##Final Project Proposal
#All about perspective
###Liz Zhang

####The idea
The world in photos is what the photographer sees, in other word, what the photographer notices. We are so used to look at the world from the photographer's perspective that we sometimes forget to ask "what would we have seen if we were there?" So how can we see things differently from a photo already taken? The lytro camera offers one option by letting the user take the photo first and focus on arbitraty object later. But that only makes the object clearer, it remains "stuck" in its "rightful" place and there is nothing it can do about it.

Except with projective transformation we can do something about it. By constructing homographies and morphing we can theratically bring any object to the real center of the camera as if we are facing right at it. And that's my final project idea. I would like to combine the lytro camera and projective transformation, so that we not only change the focus of a scene, but also its perspective so the object in question not only becomes clearer, but brought to the center of the stage.
