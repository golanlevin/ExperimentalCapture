I broadcast a live Periscope feed of a character reading an essay about ants by Lafcadio Hearn from his 1904 book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things , while jumping on a trampoline. I was interested in presenting the activities and thoughts of a fictional character, on a platform that is mostly inhabited by real people in the real world, due to Periscope’s restriction that you have to broadcast from your phone’s camera. I’m interested in making broadcasts that are only “live” in the sense of a computer executing instructions in realtime. 

The body movements are from motion capture of myself jumping on a trampoline, using the Optitrack system. The face movements were captured with Faceshift and a Microsoft Kinect. The voice is a text-to-speech voice that I purchased from iVox.  

The character held his phone in selfie posture, and spoke in a cadence tied to the rhythm of his jumping. 

I didn’t receive many reactions to the project via Periscope’s chat. Periscope is connected to Twitter, and I have less than 400 Twitter followers, so the project didn’t have great visibility to begin with. About 20 visitors came for each of the broadcasts I made. Some visitors sent hearts to me, but I received only one or two comments. 

I devoted a lot of energy to solving the technical challenges of broadcasting a constructed world. I initially pointed an iPhone at my laptop’s screen, and then later pointed it at a projection. Both approaches created serious problems for the quality of the stream – the screen created moiré patterns, and the projection created red, green and blue bands that moved across the screen. The projection was slightly better, though it’s not an ideal setup. I’d like to figure out how to publish video files directly as Periscope streams, and did some research into this, but it will require a lot of hacking on my part.

Although this project wasn’t impactful as an intervention, it gave me many ideas for what to do next, since I’d like to continue to broadcast as practice. Next time, I think I’ll need to carefully consider the fact that anything can happen in the world I construct, and I’ll need to more strategically address the question of how to disseminate the feed. I consider this piece a sketch for my final project, which will be a reenactment of Ee Ja Nai Ka, the spontaneous carnivals that occurred in Japan at the end of the Edo period. That piece will involve many characters in a constructed enviornemnt. I plan to stream the event live on YouTube, which I can do directly from my computer without a camera.
