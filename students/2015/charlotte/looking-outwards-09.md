***"We have proposed a method to create fluid animations efficiently
using sparse multi-view videos as a guide. Our method described
in Section 3 models the volume sequence from the videos. We proposed
an energy function for volume modeling with appearance
preservation. Our iterative algorithm successfully modeled more
than 1,600 fluid volumes. The fluid animation of the modeled volume
sequence can be edited by manipulating shading and physics
parameters using the built-in fluid simulator in Autodesk Maya
2015. We have demonstrated that our method allows the user to
create production-ready fluid animations from single-view videos."***
