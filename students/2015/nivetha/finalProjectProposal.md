#A view on Cellphones
##A project proposal by Nivetha Kannan

### Proposal
Every night I spend at least 30 minutes looking through my phone. I sometimes check email and sometimes check my social media.
I go through reddit and either read a comic or some fanfiction. It's strange that the last thing I see every day is my cellphone. 
But I figure it's not very strange at all. I realize that many people my age tend to end their days with a good surf over the internet via their phones.
It's an experience that allows you to connect with others (reading posts on facebook or memoirs on reddit) but is also isolated. 
It's also the highlight of my day (as sad as that sounds).

I want to make a project which douments our faces looking at our phones before going to bed. 
It'll be a video of the person from the viewpoint of their phone.

### Goals
1. Make a compelling video documenting these faces.
2. compile and make accessible data on the issue

### What I'll need:
A mobile app one can download that takes video of you while you use your phone and allows you to post your vidoe on an accesible site.
