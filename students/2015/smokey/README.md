### About Me
Hey, I'm Smokey. That's a nickname. I'm in the Emerging Media program on a track that has to do with narrative and something or other. I am a jack of all trades, and master of none. I am a photographer, and I love the analog film process. I buy old cameras at thrift stores and run around and shoot on them. I teach digital photography (and programming and game design) to small children at a [tech summer camp](http://idtech.com), so I've got my camera basics on lock. I know a thing or two about photoshop. I like theater, and I know a lot about audio recording and radio production as well as camera things. I do nothing amazing.
