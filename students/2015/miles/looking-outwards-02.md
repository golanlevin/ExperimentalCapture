### Modernity and the Problem of the Observer - Jonathan Crary 

In the introduction to *Techniques of the Observer*, Jonathan Crary outlines some of the aims and themes of the book. Broadly, he traces the construction of visuality throughout history by considering the changing status of the observer. He does this in opposition to historical narratives that could be characterized as technologically determinist. While those narratives understand social changes as the result of technological innovation, Crary sees technology as just one factor in the development of new models of visual representation. Crary makes the interesting point that optical devices are sites of knowledge and power that operate directly on the body. He also asserts that computer graphics reconfigure the relationship between vision and observer, by replacing an optically perceivable world with data. I don’t think this reconfiguration is unique to computer graphics, since spaces created in paintings are similarly severed from a real observer’s vision. In the sense that it is used to depict a world which may not exist, paint functions similarly to data.
