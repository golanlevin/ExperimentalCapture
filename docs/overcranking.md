# Overcranking (Slow-Motion)

### High-Speed Photography & Videography
*This page includes contributions by [Matt Gray](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/theatre/people/matt-gray/)*. 

Ordinary video is customarily 25 (Europe) or approximately 30 (USA) frames per second (fps). Slow-motion cinema, also known as *overcranking*, is achieved by using a special camera which can record events at higher frame rates, such as 1000fps. When this video is then played back at the usual frame rate, it appears slowed down. 

An inexpensive high-frame-rate camera is the Casio Exilim Pro EX-F1 ($750-1000), which can record low-resolution video at 300, 600, and 1200 frames per-second. Another option is the inexpensive Sony PS3-Eye USB webcam ($50) which can record 320x240 video at 120fps, yielding up to a 4x slowdown. If you have a proper budget, consider renting a Phantom high-speed camera :)

Because the exposure time of each frame is so short, high-frame-rate cameras generally require a lot of light. A lighting kit or bright sunshine is essential for good results with slow-motion cameras.

### Things to see and consider
1. Slow-motion as an analytic tool for "microexpressions"
  * Slow-motion is widely used for analyzing ballistics and other very short events ([gunshots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y9apnbI6GA), [impacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfDoQwIAaXg), etc.). However, it can also be used for analysis of ultra-fast facial expressions.

	* In Sam Taylor-Wood's [*Hysteria*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33PZhpay8gM) (1997), a woman displays extreme emotions in slow-motion. "There are no sounds, so the viewer cannot be certain whether she is moved by joy, despair or both." [Citation](http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2002/01/25/29597.html)

1. Luke DuBois, [Vertical Music](https://vimeo.com/41507465) (2012). A chamber piece written for 12 players, lasting 4 1/2 minutes. Each musician was filmed individually in several takes using a high-speed (300fps) camera and an extremely high definition (1 MHz) analog-to-digital audio recording setup. When played back at 30fps, total time is ~45 minutes.

1. Julien Maire, [*Double-Face* and *Ordonner*](http://julienmaire.ideenshop.net/project3.shtml)
  * French new-media artist Julien Maire plays fun on the concept of slow-motion cinema in these elaborately conceived simulacra, which are not actually presented in slow-motion. In one live performance (*Ordonner*), he heaves "heavy-looking" cardboard boxes which are in reality filled with helium balloons; their slow, gentle tumble through the air is a near-perfect imitation of slowmo video. In Maire's *Double-Face* performance, a coin tossed in the air tumbles ever more slowly until it eventually comes to a rest in mid-air; in fact, the coin is controlled by a mechatronic suspension system with nearly invisible guy-wires.

### Some Really Really Fast Cameras

* [Phantom cameras](http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/) can achieve about 1.4 million fps. 
* [Spinning mirror systems](http://www.stanfordcomputeroptics.com/applications/physics/rotating-mirror-camera.html) can achieve 3 million fps. 
* This [trillion-fps camera from MIT](http://video.mit.edu/watch/visualizing-video-at-the-speed-of-light-one-trillion-frames-per-second-9742/) can capture the movement of light *as it travels*. 

### Audio 

Special things happen to sound when it is slowed down *and* time-stretched. The best-known example of this is the "800% slower" Justin Bieber track, *[U Smile](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/800-slower-time-stretch)*. Note that the time-stretching preserves the original frequences of the audio, rather than causing the pitch to drop into the infrasonic range.
