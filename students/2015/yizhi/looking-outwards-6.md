This is a project done by researchers from University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Max-Planck-Institude for Informatics, and Stanford University. It detects facial expressions of one person in real time and render that expression to a real time video of another subject, regardless of what true expression is on that subject's face. 

Despite being honestly interesting. The paper mentioned several usecases for this program. For instance, translators can do more than providing the voice, but also the face morphing and the expressions to the subject of their translation. Movie makers can use one person and dozens of blank faces to shoot an entire film. There are other cases I can think of. For example, dubbing. TV series somes have horrible dubbing that doesn't match the shape of the actors' mouths. With this the little discrepancy maybe easily rectified.

I do believe this is a project with good usecases and quite interesting by itself. The real breakthrough here is the realtime transfer of facial expressions, since face morphing can be easily applied to any photos or videos already. Nevertheless, the fact that this can now be done simutaniously is something worth noting.
