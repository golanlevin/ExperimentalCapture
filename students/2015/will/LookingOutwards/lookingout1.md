Whitney Bandel's project, "Hands Up, Don't Shoot", is an interactive video that uses a kinect and processing to simulate the experience of being apprehended by the police. The participant intializes the video by putting her hands up above her head, triggering the appearance of actual footage of a person being commanded by the police to put his hands up. The movement of the participants arms up and down moves the footage backwards and forwards, thus paralleling her motions with the victim's. 

What *really* facsinates me about this project is the specific semantic value that is given to an unassuming gesture that can emobdy various meanings. Putting one's hands in the air could symbolize exercise, celebration, excitement, or in this case, submission. Context is clearly king. 

Although the technologies utilized weren't especially advanced, I was also fascinated by the unconventional use of the kinect to control a *real life "avatar"*, as opposed to digital, which was taken from actual police camera footage. The effect of this technique lends to a more compelling, immersive simulation for the participant.  

Although the video demonstrated what seems like a prototype, the experience could be made to be more immersive by incorporating surround sound audio of police sirens, and shouting of "hands up!" and "don't shoot!". To take the gestural mimicry one step further, the kinect could also detect for the gesture of hands behind one's back, simulating the experience of being handcuffed. How else might we give meaning to gestures to participate in a shared experience? High-fives, perhaps?

The artist mainly works with textiles, which she uses to "empower audiences with the ability to directly relate to a shared, intimate experience" -- an idea which she certainly explores in "Hands Up, Don't Shoot". She has taken an interest in surveillance issues and technology as they relate to individual rights, leading her to explore captured footage from a police car.
