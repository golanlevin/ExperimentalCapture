###What is it?
The skanect is a easy to use attachment for an ipad. The hardware allows you to use your ipad's camera to scan various items as 
well as full rooms. The program requires a number of apps - the main being the skanect scanner, structure, fetch, and room capture. <br><br>

Each application is good for it's ow thing. The "Room Capture" application allows you to, obviously, capture an entire room. 
The "Scanner" app allows you to scan normal 3D objects. The "Fetch" application allows you to scan part of the real world in 3D and 
use it in real time in a game environment using a unity plugin allowing experiemnts with augmented reality adn VR. The "Structure" app allows you to link your ipad to a laptop/desktop application and scan using the laptop's capabilities.

###Scanning an object using the scanner app
######A method to get quick scans with small effort
<br><br><br>
1) Place the object you are scanning on a clean surface so that the scanner has an easier time identifying what you want to scan
<br><br>
2) Open the "scanner" app on the ipad and plug in the skanect scanner. 
<br>

<br>
3) You should see a white line box on your display. Make sure it is colored red and your item is in the middle of the box. Click "Scan"
<br><br>

<br>
4) The app should start creating a mesh based on what it sees. Hold your ipad at the same spot to get a more accurate read.

<br>
5) Start moving around and above your object slowly trying to fill in all the gaps in the mesh and pausing when the app prompts you to.
<br><br>
6) After finishing, Hit the scan button again to finish your scan. You will then be able to view your scan with colors, without colors, and with only polygons.

<br>
7) Hit the email button at the top right corner to email your scan to yourself! You're done!

###  Scanning with Laptop uplink.
###### This method allows you to use your laptop's memory and capabilities, thus allowing you to scan with much more detail

<br><br>
1) Create a separate WIFI network from your computer and connect the ipad to that network in its wifi settings (on mac: click the wifi icon and go down to where it says 'Create Network..."). This makes it easier for the app and the computer to connect.
<br><br><br>

<br> 
2)Plug in your skanect and open the "structure" app on the ipad.
<br><br>
2) You should see the word 'uplink' on the right-hand side. If not, try creating another network on a different channel and connecting to that. Double check that both your laptop and ipad are on the same network.
<br>
<br> 
3) Once the 'uplink' button appears, set it to active. Download skanect desktop application on your laptop and open it. It should say 'lnked' under "structure Sensor" at the top right corner. The icon should be green as indicated in the following picture.
<br><br>

<br>
4) Adjust the settings of your first scan to what you want (ex: define that the scan is a room if you are scanning a room). Then click "Start"
<br><br>
5) Start moving around the room slowly trying to fill in all the gaps in the mesh and pausing when the app prompts you to. You should see your mesh in both the ipad display and the Laptop display. 
<br><br>
6) Hit reconstruct when you're done and th app will allow you to view your model. Continue to Process where you will be able to adjust/fix your mesh with things like filling in holes and cropping. 
<br><br>

<br>
7) Continue to "Share" to save or export your model. You're done!
