This simulator has gotten popular recently and for good reason; it captures the feeling of being left in the middle of the ocean enough so that the user starts to feel real fear, uncomfortability, and incredulousness at the situation.

I canâ€™t find the game that you can actually play because the actual link is broken; Here is the next best thing, a small walkthrough that shows the gameplay of the game:

The game takes the user on a small trip on a boat and starts when the user lands in the water and begins to lose sight of the boat. The only thing you can do to save yourself is keep scrolling up but the scenario is designed as a no-win scenario since the user will eventually have no choice but to give up scrolling and die or to continue scrolling infinitely. 
After more digging I have found that the oculus is actually compatible with this game but sadly does not offer more to the experience since the game is primarily video shot. This could have been solved by used a 360 video camera in conjunction with the oculus and gaming mechanics. It may be a worthwhile experiment to try for someone in the future.
