# Undercranking & Time-Lapse

Frames of video are recorded at intervals less than the standard 25-30fps but then played at the normal frame rate. Alternatively, regular video is simply sped up, causing some frames to be dropped. This technique is extensively used in security/surveillance, scientific video, and documentary videos of processes which take a long time to complete (such as the construction of a building).

Recent iOS iPhones will record time-lapse videos. Many camera manufacturers also have inexpensive software that allow you to control your camera automatically, such as Nikon's Camera Control Pro. [Here's a simple Processing program](http://www.flong.com/blog/archives/85) which allows for time-lapse from any video camera.
