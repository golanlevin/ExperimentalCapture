*Untitled (Underkey)* is an image of a section of a keyboard with the keys removed. It’s made of 130 smaller photos stitched together, taken with a 5MP USB microscope. I took photos of a keyboard in a computer cluster in the computer science building on campus. I was fascinated by the history revealed by the accumulation I found under the keys – of skin flakes, hair, blood and dust. In the way that it captures detritus from the people who use it, the keyboard functions as a kind of covert storage device. 

The next step for this project is to capture the entire keyboard. In this iteration, I moved the keyboard by hand each time I took a photo. Though I think the presence of my hand in the photo is interesting, the human error I introduced did complicate the stitching process.  Ideally, I would be able to move the keyboard by a constant amount for each photo, which might be possible with a conveyor belt attached to two stepper motors.
