### Time-Lapse 

This Processing program for time-lapse recording connects to the computer’s built-in web camera (or other attached video camera), and then stashes images from the camera to the hard disk at regular intervals. (The program will start recording consecutively-numbered images into the Sketch Folder for that program, which you can access from the Sketch menu. To compile a video from these images, import them into your favorite video editor, such as Quicktime Pro, AfterEffects or FinalCut).

### Stop-Frame Capture

The following code for a stop-frame animation tool is very similar, but it only records images to disk when the user clicks the mouse or presses a key on the keyboard. It also includes a very basic “onion-skinning” feature, which allows you to see the current video signal in relation to the previously captured image.
