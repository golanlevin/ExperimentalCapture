My project is an interpretation of *Ee Ja Nai Ka*, the spontaneous peasant uprisings that occurred in 1860s Japan. This virtual Ee Ja Nai Ka will occur in a constructed environment, populated by a variety of characters, plants and objects. In the current rendition of the project, the characters are situated on the wings of a small, marooned aircraft. While I donâ€™t intend for the project to be a faithful reenactment of Ee Ja Nai Ka, I do aim to address how the carnivalesque has historically functioned as an outlet for unexpressed frustrations. The movements of the characters will be derived from full-body motion capture data, and they will fall into and jostle each other dynamically. I will broadcast a live stream of the event on YouTube over a period of several days.
