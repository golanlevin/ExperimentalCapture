In thinking about capturing a childhood object, I wanted to capture the phenomenon of light focusing through a magnifying glass onto a point, a classic childhood experiment that engenders curiosity, amusement, and perhaps a bit of mischief, even. Initially, I thought the thermal camera would capture the spirit of scientific experimentation, given its objectivity, and the heat emission of the focused light. After learning about Schlieren photography in class one day, however, I was inspired to try to produce my own. 

After a weekend of trying to hack together a [Schlieren photography set-up](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Schlieren-Flow-Visualization/) using items from around the house (fresnel lenses, LED light), I was not able to reproduce the effect. There were too many possible sources of error I was unable to diagnose the source of the issue, unfortunately. It could've have been the distances between the lenses, the angling of the lenses, the positioning of the LED, the type of LED, the positioning of the camera, the type of camera lens, etc.  

Ultimately, I decided to return to my original idea of using the thermal camera to capture the experiment. The capture was fairly straightforward, so I decided to play with the presentation of the still life. I wanted to stretch the tradition of presenting in a single frame, and so I borrowed the idea of ["aspect-to-aspect" transition panels](http://www.fourcolorcriticism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Aspect-to-Aspect-small.jpg) that are used in comic art, which unlike other types of transition panels, do not deal with time at all. Multiple views of a particular environment or scene effectively freeze time to establish a mood or feeling. It has been referred to as "the wandering eye", scanning the environment and absorbing contextual details.

So I present multiple views of the same scene, one where a child might be conducting her magnifying experiment, which flip between the normal image and thermal image of the same shot.

Regarding my output, I felt success simply in producing something worth showing to the class, especially after the Schlieren failure. I also felt success in my application of the aspect-to-aspect transition as a way to capture the fleeting quality of my childhood "object" - the spirit of experimentation - while still operating within the bounds of "still life". 

Where I fell short was thinking through the legibility of my presentation, which suggests a narrative, and the effect of leaving the thermal images as-is, in their highly objective, scientific state. Unfortunately, this caused dissonance with the more lyrical presentation of the normal images. Given more time, I would explore the colors of thermal images further. The timing of the animation was also quite sterile and monotonous, so that stands to improve as well.
