a project about navigating hidden spaces through a mediator

maximizing tiny distances by removing line of sight, replacing it with invisible transmisson

a extraterrestrial rover for an aquarium, or the next room over

explore the black box

*so far*

-hacked apart a couple rc cars for parts

-electrified the internal RF transmittor for increased range

-mini camera to external RF on a different frequency 

-new treads

-battery solutions for portability

-camera quality tests (low light, light on rover)

-compression and transmission artifacts could not be better

-remote control attached to arduino

-scale tests in cardboard

-only one camera fried to bits so far

RIP little camera

*the future*

-things need to get smaller (or worst-case scenario the camera needs to be lower on the body of the rover)

-need to gear down the servos

-hinge legs?

-landscape! (this is going to be built in a full half of my studio?)

-probably out of plaster, a grey world with colored light

-connect to web cam, have controlling available online?

-or try to talk a gallery into visually closing the entire space except for a TV in the doorway
