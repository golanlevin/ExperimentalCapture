# Experimental Capture

### Computational and Expanded ███ography
Prof. [Golan Levin](http://flong.com), Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2015. <br />
Course numbers: 16-461 (Robotics Institute), 60-461/761 (Art) <br />
M/W 1:30-2:50pm, in HL-A10A and the STUDIO (CFA-111). <br />

> <small>This is an interdisciplinary course in experimental media practices that arise from using devices to "capture" the world. We will survey state-of-the-art techniques and emerging ideas, in the industry and in academia, to capture, model, and render objects, people, places and events. The course evaluation will be project-based, in which students will capture a wide variety of things, and develop projects around the data they collect. We will cover capture techniques including motion capture, video-based capture, panoramic and hyperspectral imaging, depth sensors, 3D scanners, hand and eye-gaze trackers; classic and contemporary representations of face and body pose and motion; and recent progress in animation, synthesis, classification, and rehabilitation on new forms of displays. Please note that there are usage/materials fees associated with this course.</small>

### Learning Objectives

This is an interdisciplinary course in experimental media practices that arise from using devices to "capture" the world. In this course, we seek:

* *To explore the affordances of exotic, forgotten, and nascent image capture technologies in revealing unseen or alternative realities.*
* *To explore the use of computation in expanding our expressive vocabulary for representations of people, objects, environments, and events.*
* *[To question the practical and epistemological assumptions](docs/assumptions.md) that underpin the project of capturing representations of reality with devices.*

At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to 

* Recognize and identify the use of expanded capture techniques (such as photogrammetry, motion capture, hyperspectral imaging, binaural audio, stroboscopy, etc.) in popular and experimental media. 
* Demonstrate understanding of the scientific principles and/or engineering foundations underlying such techniques, in revealing phenomena beyond the limits of ordinary human perception.
* Demonstrate understanding of the poetic and elucidative potentials of such techniques, and their application to the production of expressive and provocative new culture.
* Command the practical use of one or more such techniques.

### Deliverables 

Our semester is organized around four main projects:

1. **[An Object](docs/assignment1-object.md)** *("Still Life")* - Due Wed., September 23
1. **[A Person in Time](docs/assignment2-person.md)** *("Portrait")* - Due Mon., October 19
1. **[A Place](docs/assignment3-place.md)** *("Landscape")* - Due Wed., November 18
1. **[Final Project](docs/assignment4-final.md)**: Due and Exhibited Wed., December 9. <br />*It is expected (but not required) that the Final Project will be a revised version of one of the first three projects.*

In addition to the above, students are also expected to complete: 

* One **[Technical Assistance Tutorial](docs/tutorials.md)**.  
* Ten brief "**[Looking Outwards](docs/looking-outwards.md)**" reports, on an approximately weekly schedule. 

All assignment submissions will take the form of pull requests on Github. For more information, please see [Submitting Work](docs/submitting-work.md).
