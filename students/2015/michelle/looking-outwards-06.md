Acoustruments is a way of creating tangible interactions with mobile devices using ultrasonic sensing. The microphone emits near-ultrasonic sweeps that travel along a pipe back to the speaker, which can detect any changes to that sound profile. In regards to software, the signal is processed using the Fast Fourier Transform and the different sound profiles can be trained using machine learning. The acoustruments themselves are basically plastic external applications that can be designed in any way, shape, or form. In the example photos below, they come in an interactive toy, iPad game components, and a controller for Google Cardboard that were all 3D printed.

The technology was inspired by wind instruments, since they manipulate the quality of a sound by simply manipulating the physical properties of the channel. The researchers of Acoustruments explored several design primitives that can easily be expanded into a variety of applications. Simple properties like blocking or elongating a pipe can lead to tilt sensors, pressure sensors, rotary encoders, and etc.

I actually was able to work on demos for this research over the summer and I believe this technology has a lot of potential for consumer applications. I especially think they have a possibility in tactile children's toys, as they add an extra level of interaction to mobile apps and games. The downsides right now would be that ultrasonic interference can disturb the signal processing, and also that the current freuqencies of the iPhone are still audible to dogs or younger people.
