# Deja Vu Music Video

[Deja Vu](https://kamra.invisi-dir.com/)

This project is an interactive music video for KAMRA, by [The Invisible Designs Lab](http://invisi.jp/). The interactive website captures an image of your face, and then uses this in a variety of trips ways - mapping the mesh around a face image, distorting the texture, some slit-scanning, creating new faces, using other faces, and more - all in sync with the music.

It’s a strange effect, watching your own face get distorted to such lengths - Kamra’s music seems to go hand in hand with the feeling: Deja Vu. Definitely needs to be experienced, [click here](https://kamra.invisi-dir.com/) and check it out.
