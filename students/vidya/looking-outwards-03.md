‘The Artist is Present’
I recently discovered a new artist Marina Abramovic. 
Her work that is most inspiring to me ‘Artist is Present’. 
I find this a  as a brilliant piece of work because we always go to museums and look at an artists piece of work but never do we really get to see the artist face to face. 
I like how brave Marina is in doing this sitting for eight hours a day for three months. By doing this, she is in contact with many people 
visiting the museum and there is some kind of connection she makes with each and every person.
A connection that her work cannot make with the audience but her presence can. I think this piece also comes in a from of completion when she meets her long, lost love. I felt a satisfying moment 
“this is why we do art”. This piece is just my favorite!
