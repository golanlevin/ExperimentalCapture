#Final Project Proposal

I would like to continue exploring the creative potentials of using lidar to reveal the latent patterns and forms emergent in temporal extrusions of space. 

There are three aspects which particularly interest me:

**THE ACT OF OBSERVATION**: The relationship between the observer and the observed; How this manifests in a capture and what this reveals about the behavioral dynamics of the system (the system being secret recording or "candid" portraiture). This route focuses on the artifacts and social implications of capture. The emphasis is on process.

**VIRTUAL & TEMPORAL SPACES**: The emergent properties of temporal extrusions (i.e. all individuals facing the same direction in a hallways, etc.). I'm interested in exploring the architecural and aesthetic properties these spaces and the time-based artifacts therein. This approach is more "pure data" or "pure capture." The focus is on the relationship between the object of capture and the capture. The emphasis is on visualization.

**THOSE YET TO BE DISCOVERED**: There are many explorations I would like to continue involving the lidar. For example: translating streets into sounds, helical vertical extrusions, still 360 degree captures, etc.

You can find some of my recent progress [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Final%20Project/Final%20Project.md). This project will resume my explorations of Project 3, which you can find [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Project%203/Project%203.md).
