I'm going to create long exposure style heat map images. Using videos from the FLIR heat camera I will overlay the frames to create one image with "trails". My current idea for what to capture is the flow of people though streets, and walk ways. Using a FlIR heat camera in the cold outdoor weather will bring the humans moving though space stand out. I'm also interested in exploring other scenes that may be interesting in in the IR world over long periods of time. As well as the actual shooting of video, I will need to spend time working with the frames of video to boil them down to a single image. The attached image is a traditional (visible light) long exposure image of people moving. I'm hoping to achieve a similar effect, but with an even stronger enfasis on the patterns of movement.
