This is a project done by the Active Vision Group in Oxford University.
The video demonstrate the work of Augmented Reality tracking system. A stero pair is connected to a computer, which tracks the camera and builds out the environment realtime. 
The system is able to handle changes in scale, as shown in the video, the overlayed animation automatically changes its size as the camera moves closer or further from the pin point. 
Another notable feature is that the camera not only serves as a scene capture device, but can also be a source of input. By moving the camera around, the video shows that it can draw a scorched outline on the environment.
Combining all these features, the video showed an awsome demonstration of a virtual computer game set on the office table.

This system has a wide potential application from animation, game design, to space exploration simulation. And I do believe that it can be improved by making the hardware smaller and even wearable (perhaps like Google glasses), which is much more practicle than carrying a huge screen with a camera attached in front.
