### About Me

Ryan Huber is a designer and developer from Nashville, TN. He values creative, thoughtful, elegant, and accessible solutions to challenges and is passionate about using technology to enhance people's lives. He is happiest when he is involved in all parts of the design process – from ideation to visual design to bringing things to life in code. In 2015, Ryan left his job as lead designer / developer for a small web team at Vanderbilt University to pursue his Masters in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon, where he now studies. He and his husband have been together since their freshman year of college (in 2002) and have one small charming, but spoiled, dog. Ryan spends much of his free time volunteering in various leadership positions for the nonprofit organization Destination Imagination®, a program that asks small teams of students to use creativity and teamwork to solve multidisciplinary challenges.
