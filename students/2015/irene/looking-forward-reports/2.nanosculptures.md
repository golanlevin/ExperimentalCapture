The Nano Sculptures of Jonty Hurtwitz

Imagine a scultpure that fits on the head of an ant, or on a human hair. Accidentally stumbling on the art of Jonty Hurtwitz this weekend has expanded the way I think about sculpture and our relationship to art that we cannot experience physically, but engage with intellectually. Hurtwitz art *can* be viewed on a microscope, which means one can only engage with it thorugh a screen and a mouse. It can't even be replicated or copied in the way that mass art is reprinted all over the world. Hurwitz writes, "Can you be sure of its existance if your basic senses are telling you that nothing is there?"

Hurwitz, an engineer turned scultpor, has created the world's "smallest scultpure of form" (an artist in the guiness records) out of UV light and polymers. The technique is amazing. If you illumniate a light-sensitive polymer with UV wavelenghts, it hardens. Dentists use this technique to glue fillings with UV light. But using a slightly longer wavelength intense light causes something similar called the "two photon absorption". Wherever the intense light is focused, the polymer will absorb two photons and act *as if* it had been illumniated by UV light - meaning the polymer will solidify. The benefit of the two photon absortion technique is that it can occur on a tiny tiny focal point - something Hurwitz describes as a tiny 3D pixel (also called a Voxel). He literally assembled his sculptures by directing light to create each single pixel, layer by layer. 

The 3D models themselves were assembled using photogrammetry (and a real, professional camera rig).

How small are these sculptures then? Approximately 80 x 100 x 20 microns. To put that in context, a human hair is about 100 microns thick. Sadly, they're so small that Hurwitz and his team have actually lost the sculptures!

## Inspiration

Hurwitz is as inspired by modern math and physics as he is by classical works of art. After discovering Leonardo Da Vinci's writings he delved into a wide range of [works](http://www.jontyhurwitz.com/anamorphosis) related to [anamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis). We can see that he was already playing with the idea of perception. For the nano project Hurwitz looked into the work of Italian sculptor Antonio Canova, specifically his ["Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss."](http://musee.louvre.fr/oal/psyche/psyche_acc_en.html)

## My take 

I admire how Hurwitz's art creates a sense of wonder of science. How not to marvel at the amazing properties of light? It must have been incredibly difficult to conceptualize a project that was not clearly visible, graspable, or buildable. 

It would have been interesting to see him explore beyond the physical form of the human body. Perhaps he could even expand on an already existing nano structure and build something that integrates with its natural form.
