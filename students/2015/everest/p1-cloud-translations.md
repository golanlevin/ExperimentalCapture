<b>cloud translation</b>

this system utilizes google maps, google streetview data, and an optical character recognition library to wander the world and translate the clouds. a map is presented on the left of the screen- when the visitor to the page clicks on the map, they are directed to the closest street. if streetview photographs are available, they are then shown in the right-hand pane. these photographs always have a heading of 180 degrees; they are always looking up. these photographs are then sent through an ocr library (ocrad js), which attempts to make some sense of the images as text, resulting in a (more or less) concrete poem. the ocr library is fond of telephone wires.

at the start of this project, i was thinking a lot about under-utilized digital data, as well as ways to present that data in meaningful and playful ways. i also had typewriter art and historical methodologies of illustration on my mind. although translating the clouds ('look! its a rabbit!') might be a bit on the nose, i hoped the mediation by machine might bring back some strange mystery or austerity.
