### Bump

*Bump* is a music video created for the band Ethereal (feat. Lord Narf) by the production company [Pomp&Clout](http://www.pompandclout.com/), which has experience in music videos. The music video is a 3D rendered and animated world, and it uses 3D scanning (They use [structure.io](http://www.structure.io/))and motion capture work to create a surreal reality. Here is a [BTS Tweet](https://twitter.com/pompandclout/status/599647581656887296).

It's hard to fault the technical aspect of the video, as the video is so knowningly technically imperfect. Artistically, some decisions didn't seem to mesh with the rest of the video as much. I got the the artists included a fair amount of test footage to 'fill in the gaps' so to speak. For example, the sword draw towards the end seemed to have no purpose other than 'why not?'. I enjoyed the surreal world and it's lack of rules - the video could have spent more time in the kitchen, instead of the out-of-knowhere cuts.

What is especially fascinating to me about this video is how wholly it embraces the 'uncanny valley'. All of the perspective faults, strange scanning artifacts, and weird moCap glitches are not only present in the video, but on display. The goal, it seems, was to use the technology for the sake of what most would consider it's mistakes/disadvantages. This is combined with interesting depth of field rending effects, curious compositional/cutting choices, time ramps and warps, and a great many non-conventional ("wrong/inaccurate") video production decisions. No groundbreaking technological achievments here, but a unique utilization of artifacts present in the technology manage to create a hyper surreal music video.
