### Lazy Pen by Nahornyj Nicolas

A French interaciton designer recently created a device to make typing more personal without the use of emoticons. It's called the [Lazy Pen](http://www.nahornyj.com/lazypen.html).

It works as such: two rests in front of the keyboard hold the palm of each hand and move from side to side and up and down according to how the user types. These movements are translated into changes of each letter as it is typed, conveying the individual's emotion and personality through the written form.

My biggest criticism of this piece is that the translation of hand movements to letter shape is an abstract generalization of how real handwritten notes are made. Furthermore, the movements made while typing are of different origin than those made while writing by hand. 

However, the typed forms *within the structure of Lasy Pen* do have a characteristic "signature," just as any individual would use a device differently than the next person to use it. This behavioral "signature," in depth of profundity, cannot compare to handwritten idiosyncracies, though the piece is a novel step toward man-machine virtuosity.
