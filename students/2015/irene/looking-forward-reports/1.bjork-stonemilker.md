For decades, Bjork has managed to creatively and beautifully raise the bar for what can be made at the bleeding edge of music, film, and tech arts. One of her most recent productions is a VR video of "Stonemilker" crafted by VX wunderdirector [Andrew Thomas Huang](http://www.andrewthomashuang.com/). Check out the video on YouTube 360 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQEyezu7G20) (watch it up to 2160p). The video shows Bjork in a cold, dark Icelandic beach wearing a bright neon yellow dress. She walks around you, so you'll find yourself turning the camera's POV to find her. At times you'll also see two or three Bjorks on the screen. 

Even though the video is quite simple (it was filmed in only 2 hours!), Bjork is one of the first musicians to embrace VR as a medium. Even simple scenes and character movements could potentially create whole new experiences for viewers. Plus, the video was made for an Oculus-type device or immersive room. No doubt that experience is much more compelling than YouTube - sound being a key component of that experience. According to Bjork, "I had recorded the strings with a clip on mike on each instrument. We have made a different mix where we have fanned this in an intimate circle around the listener. So as you watch this in the virtual reality headset it will be as if you are on that beach and with the 30 players sitting in a circle tightly around you..." I applaude her readiness to embrace new forms of media production. That said, I do think the duo could have used perspective and space (the sky, the beach floor) more dynamically to encourage viewers to explore the exotic space around them. As it is, one is mostly chasing after Bjork. 

I believe Bjork and Huang collaborated with Chris Milk's and Aaron Koblin's new company VRSE. They used a 360 VRSE.works camera to capture the footage. Milk has been pushing hard for VR film for a while and its possible he inspired Huang to use the new medium. "Stonemilker" led me to more work by VRSE including an interesting VR documentary they recently shot for the UN.
