This is a rework of a previous project of mine in order to make it more immersive.
I sought to bring out the essence of classical still lives through a digital re-interpretation or capture of the original art work. In this project, I choose Georgia o'Keeffe since her still lives have a very powerful connotation to the human body. I wanted to bring the painting to life by animating it with the human body. In my first iteration of the project, we used mortion capture footage of a woman opening and closing her legs in order to cause the blooming and closing of the flower in her paintings. This time, I worked to set up a real time capture rig so that much like my second project ("Smile" with Vidya) I am able to capture an interactive experience in which the subject performs to engage the painting and the painting, in turn, performs for the subject.

## How?
The Computer has a simple program that regcognizes a marker placed on the seat. When the marker is covered, it means that a person is sitting with their legs closed on the seat. Otherwise the person has their legs slightly open. Using the information of whther or not the marker was showing, the program decided when to make the flower bloom and when to close it. Overall, the program worked pretty consistently to detect when legs were spread. In a sense, the unforgiving quality of the program also policed how the audience should be sitting. In the real world women are shamed for sitting too 'provocatively' or too 'masculine' if they sit with their legs spread. This program however rewarded the user for spreading their legs by letting Georgia O'keeffe's paintings bloom. The project celebrated sexuality and women in all their many forms. 

##Edits:

After showing this project to others. It was suggested that the documentation would look best as a movie-like gif. Here is the end result:

Unfortunately, the Gif size is still too big. I will try lowering the size and putting up edits once more.
