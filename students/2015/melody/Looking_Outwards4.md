#Postgram

“Postgram” is an interactive project created by Sebastian Vargas, who claims it is a “bot for human story-telling” and a narrative of public data usage, privacy, and image use. The software uses instagram by geolocating the location of every photo that is tagged to @post.gram, finding an individual residing near the location associated with the photo through a public directory, and then contacting said individual by sending him/her a “postcard” of the photo uploaded and a request to meet with Sebastian to discuss the project. 

The project explores the accessibility of information in the Digital Age, the role of unwilling participants in “art”, and the progress technology has made in making ourselves present, even when we don’t notice. Through Sebastian’s ability to access someone’s personal information, such as location and contact information, his project illustrates how quickly privacy can be breached by unknown forces. Simultaneously intriguing and curious, “postgram” can easily be interpreted as equally unsettling.
