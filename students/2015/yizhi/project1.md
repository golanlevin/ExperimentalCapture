##Inspiration
Paper art is one of the things that used to amaze us like magic tricks.

As a child, one would spend a whole day doing paper folding. Paper cranes, paper frogs, paper mouse. Even if you never owned a glass jar in which you collected paper stars that you made over time, I'm pretty sure that at some point in life you have thrown a paper plane at your buddy, with words written inside.

Paper art is fun and used to be a release of our imagination. But as we grow up, this craft that once brought each of us something unique is gradually forgotten. Folding a bird requires time and produces no cash in exchange, which is barely compatible with the incredibly fast-paced and pragmatic life for grown-ups. 

So as I asked my friends: "Is there something special to you as a child, something that is no longer with you, something you miss?" 5 out of 7 gave me names of various kinds of paper toys. I picked my favourite, a paper bunny to represent paper art - the lost treasure from childhood for our generation.

##Capture
The capture of the paper bunny is a creation of 3D model from 103 photos using Agisoft PhotoScan.
The photo shooting process involves setting the bunny on a tripod against a white wall, putting the camera on a second tripod, and spinning the bunny around on the pedal to take its pictures from all points of view.

The photos was aligned using PhotoScan.

##Post-production
The post-production is finding a way to present this special object. And I used Photoshop(and yes, only Photoshop) for that purpose.
I first made a GIF with the bunny moving. The bunny will drop from outside the upper border of the image to a slope and slide down and disappear from the image. A still image taken from that GIF looks like below:

To better present the bunny in the syntax of lost childhood object. I made the four cinemagraphs. Each taken at a scene of our daily life. With the bunny sitting at the corner of each image. In all images the bunny is the 3D model build from the still images. Not the actual paper bunny.

A Drop from Nowhere takes from Alice in Wonderland, where Alice drops into a rabbit hole and founds herself in a curious world. So what happens if we reverse the process and a rabbit from Wonderland falls to our world. Here Wonderland is our childhood, which sounds a bit distant and curious for us but is part of us anyway. And if this paper bunny that we made when we were five falls into our world now, what is he going to see.

He is going to see the familiar places, a bedroom, a study, a kitchen, dining room... All the usual places in a home. Except this is an apartment now that you might be sharing with someone else and not your mum and dad. In all four cinemagraphs the bunny is places on the edge or at the corner of the image. He is quietly observing, not daring to intrude and in some sense, this old friend from our past is just not the center of life anymore.

The first two images are taken with slow motion, time-lapsed. The last two have their speed accelerated. Because looking at the place that we are living right now, a lot has not changed, like we still have these things in our rooms, but a lot has changed as well. And the changes can be disrputive and the reason why paper bunnies are not part of our life any more. And the first three has their background pixelized as if they are part of a story book, or imagination, or memory, like the bunny, which represented in 3D, is unreal. The last one with the cars moving quickly has its background completely in its real state. So the contrast become strongest in the last image, where it became clear what is past and what is present, what is unreal and what is real. And this contrast can be agitating to watch.

##Critique

###3D Scanning
The 3D scanning is the part that I am mostly unsatisfed about. I am sure that it can be done more gracefully. I experimented with iSense scanner first but that doesn't work very well on small objects. Agisoft Photoscan did a good job aligning the photos, but because the bunny was made out of paper, there are parts where the paper is thin that even PhotoScan did not capture very well. Perhaps next time I should try a better approach to scan small objects with textures and uneven parts.

###Lighting
In the post-production, the artificial lighting was not as good as I hoped. The main constraint is the fact that I am using photoshop and I fear the functions for manipulating 3D objects are not as powerful as its other features. Next time I'll try some other tools to deal with 3D models.
