# Long Exposure and Light Painting

![Long exposure by Matthew Fang](images/long-exposure-matthew-fang.jpg)

Long exposure is an ideal technique for visualizing trajectories, gestures and other movements. *Technically*, we can accomplish long exposures through techniques such as: 

* An actual long exposure, i.e. controlling shutter timing on a DSLR
* Custom software and other scripts which blend adjacent frames
* iPhone apps, etc.

Many terrific examples of long-exposure photography can be found in Nicholas Felton's new book, [*PhotoViz*](http://usshop.gestalten.com/photoviz.html), and are discussed in [this terrific lecture at Webstock '15](https://vimeo.com/122852255). Felton speaks about how "the intersection of photography and data visualization is a place where optical techniques reveal complex phenomena and data viz starts to resemble a photographic process."

### For viewing and consideration: Nature

* Solargraphy is a technique in which a fixed pinhole camera is used to expose photographic paper for an extremely long amount of time (sometimes half a year). It is most often used to show the path taken by the Sun across the sky. "The image below was recorded with a pinhole camera made from a drink can lined with a piece of photographic paper. The simple camera continuously records the Sun's path each day as a glowing trail burned into the photosensitive paper. Dark gaps in the daily arcs are caused by cloud cover, whereas continuous bright tracks record glorious spells of sunny weather."
