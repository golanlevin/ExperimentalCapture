### Experimental Capture

In this looking outwards, I will primarily deal with capturing motion.

### Virtual Motion in Motion Simulation
http://www.motionsimulation.com/

In this project a company is using VR technologies in order to create a virtual experience racing a car, flying a plane, etc. VR as of now has to rely on headgear that is too clunky and also has to compete with the fact that people do not actually want to move during virtual sims. This leaves us with having to accomodate the player with games where the player is sitting. The Motion simulation orb shown here is a perfect example of not only having the user sit (and it makes sense to have the user sit) but also to put them into an immersive, VR-like environment. 
The Orb is still being developed but I think that things such as this have a different sort of potential than something like the oculus rift. The orb gives us the oppurtunity for capturing an experience like driving and the mutate it to something exciting, foriegn and interesting. This is where Motion Simulation falls short. They so not remove themselves from vehicles that users are familiar with (probably because they market this as a training sort of equipment); the ontly advantage to the sphere right now is that you can psuedo-experience flying a helicopter rather than actually going out to ride one. Instead of stinking with the familiar, this orb can take us to unfamiliar hieghts such as space travel, traveling into someones body, conrolling the body of a bird, etc.

A project similar to this and which probably inspired this sphere is the idea of a motion capture tent in which users are plunged into a virtual environment without the need for headgear but sadly with limited space. 
A large iteration of this idea here:

###Burning Man VR Tent

This AOL video can probably explain it better:

This is exciting to think about because of the sheer size of that tent. This isn't going to be a 4 x 4 space and because of that we have a lot more gaming, creative, and illurtative things we can do with the space. 
This is a great way of capturing the motion of hundreds of participants in order to read motion data, introduce new gaming techiniques, and actually see how a crowd responds to VR. Will we be stabilized by the company of others? Or will it be another confusing, lackluster experience? I'm not sure of all the VR demos will bring anything new but it is worth getting excited about.
