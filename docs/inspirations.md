### Aertryck & Danielson, *Ten Meter Tower*

[Maximilien van Aertryck and Axel Danielson, *Ten Meter Tower*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/opinion/ten-meter-tower.html) (2017)

> "*Our objective in making this film was something of a psychology experiment: We sought to capture people facing a difficult situation, to make a portrait of humans in doubt. We’ve all seen actors playing doubt in fiction films, but we have few true images of the feeling in documentaries. To make them, we decided to put people in a situation powerful enough not to need any classic narrative framework. A high dive seemed like the perfect scenario.*"

### Heather Dewey-Hagborg, *Stranger Visions*

Regarding Heather Dewey-Hagborg's tour-de-force [*Stranger Visions*](http://deweyhagborg.com/projects/stranger-visions) (2013), the artist writes:

> In *Stranger Visions* I collected hairs, chewed up gum, and cigarette butts from the streets, public bathrooms and waiting rooms of New York City. I extracted DNA from them and analyzed it to computationally generate 3d printed life size full color portraits representing what those individuals might look like, based on genomic research. Working with the traces strangers unwittingly left behind, the project was meant to call attention to the developing technology of forensic DNA phenotyping, the potential for a culture of biological surveillance, and the impulse towards genetic determinism.
