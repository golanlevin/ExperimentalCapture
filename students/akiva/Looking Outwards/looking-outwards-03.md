#Skataviz by Design I/O

Skataviz is a prototype piece of software that attempts to capture and visualize the movement of a skateboard. To accomplish this goal a simple iPod touch is attached to the bottom of a skateboard and an app sends accelerometer data back to a computer. This movement data is captured at the same time as video of the skateboarder. By overlaying the data on to the video Skataviz is able to make the raw accelerometer data much more meaningful. Skatboard tricks are by there nature time based and fleeting. They have a choreographed component and an improvised component. Skataviz has the potential to capture both the live nature of each performance and the subtleties of choreography. In future iterations of the software it would be great to see tools for manipulating the captured data.
