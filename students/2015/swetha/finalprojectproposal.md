For this project, I would like to re visit my first project which used motion capture of a woman spreading her legs to bloom one of Georgia O'Keeffe's paintings.

I want to improve upon this so that the piece works in real time so that anyone can sit in front of Georgia O'Keeffe's work and make the flowers bloom and close depending on their leg positions.
In order to do this, I will use computer vision to recognize when the person is interacting with the painting and when their thighs are closed or open. This diagram explains what I have in mind:

This design may change but it demonstrated the basic idea; the computer keeps track of what is on the seat and thus can guess when the seat is being used and thus when the flower should bloom. In order to further this project, I also want the user to be able to affect many flowers, not just one, because of the feedback I recieved during the crit for this work. To do this, I will animate more of Georgia O'Keeffe's paintings.

I will, in the end, document the piece as if it were a gallery installation.
