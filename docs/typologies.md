# Typologies and Small Multiples

> ***Nothing is more amazing than the simple truth, nothing is more exotic than our own surroundings, nothing is more fantastic in effect than objective description, and nothing is more remarkable than the time in which we live.* <br />—Egon Erwin Kish**

In this lecture, we examine *collections* through the related concepts of "small multiples" in information visualization, and "typologies" in photography.

## Small Multiples

A *small multiple* is a series of similar graphs or charts using the same scale and axes, which allow them to be easily compared. The term was popularized by information designer Edward Tufte, [who wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple): 

> At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: *Compared to what?* Small multiple designs, multivariate and data bountiful, answer directly by visually enforcing comparisons of changes, of the differences among objects, of the scope of alternatives. For a wide range of problems in data presentation, small multiples are the best design solution.

Artist Kim Dingle went to high schools in Las Vegas and asked them to draw the united states on a sheet of 8.5x11 paper. She then transfered these as small multiples to a common canvas, entitled *United Shapes of America*:

![](images/typologies/datavis_dingle_united_shapes.jpg)

In Meaghan Kombol's *The Subway Lines*, the artist attempted to draw straight lines while riding the NYC subway. The result is a set of small multiples which are at once highly personal, yet also intersubjectively valid depictions of reality:

It is also possible to use photographs (and not just charts or diagrams) in small multiples. Eadweard Muybridge's gridlike presentation of frames from the horse in motion provide comparative context for the special "key" frame that won the famous bet — showing all four hooves off the ground. *These are organized in time.*

Here's a photographic small multiple which depicts "what 200 calories looks like". *These are organized by caloric density.*

## Typologies

[**Exploring photography as a tool for visual classification**](https://www.photopedagogy.com/typologies.html): 

> Throughout the modern era, photography has been enlisted to classify the world and its people. Driven by a belief in the scientific objectivity of photographic evidence, the logics utilized to classify photographs—in groups and categories or sequences of identically organized images—also shape our visual consciousness. In the twenty-first-century, new digital technologies and globalization have radically transformed the applications of photography, making the reconsideration of photographic information systems ever more urgent.
— from *The Order of Things*, an exhibition at the Walther Collection, 2015

> [...] The camera has been used as a tool for witnessing and classifying types of subjects - people, buildings, objects etc. - gathering this evidence together in one place (often a book or exhibition) so that the viewer is able to see and assess it. This approach to photography is sometimes referred to as typological, a typology being a study or interpretation of types of things.

![](images/typologies/roth_on_talbot_daguerre.jpg)

Photography, from its beginnings in the 1830s, has been preoccupied with cataloguing. Richard Roth has written: 

> In William Henry Fox Talbot's *The Library* (1845) and Louis Daguerre's *Shells and Fossils* (1839), we see illustrated the curatorial nature of photography— a medium concerned, to a large degree, with preserving the present (no matter how ordinary) and cataloguing phenomena. The *series* is the backbone of photo sensibility: It implies a belief in scientific method. 'One' example is not sufficiently evidential ('one' might be a coincidence), but 'many', repeatedly, are compelling – they become proof."

Typically, and unlike small multiples, typologies depict a *collection*, and not necessarily an *ordered set*.

### Wilson A. "Snowflake" Bentley (1865-1931)

Wilson Alwyn Bentley was the first known photographer of snowflakes. He invented a process of catching flakes on black velvet in such a way that their images could be captured before they either melted or sublimated.

### Bernd and Hilla Becher

Masters of the photographic typology, Bernd and Hilla Becher spent more than 30 years documenting architectural forms they referred to as “anonymous sculpture”.

### Ed Ruscha

> Ruscha explains that he 'had no real agenda or message' when photographing the swimming pools, gas stations and parking lots of Los Angeles, yet found an artistic value and new perspective in shooting the scenes from above. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=16&v=0xboX5cvIzw)

### Michael Wolf, Bastard Chairs

> By using a diverse array of perspectives and visual approaches, Wolf uses his camera to reveal the human energy that flows through the contemporary city. In so doing, he establishes himself not only as a photographer of the urban structure, but of the myriad ways in which people adapt to and reconfigure this rapidly changing environment, thereby providing us with a fascinatingly intricate portrait of life in the city. (From [here](https://www.photopedagogy.com/typologies.html))

### People of the Twenty‐First Century

Hans Eijkelboom's [*People of the Twenty‐First Century*](https://www.complex.com/style/2015/01/hans-eijkelboom-people-of-the-twenty-first-century-book) depicts sartorial "tribes".

### Heads

Notice the regularization strategies employed by Alex Kayser in his *Heads* collection:

### Skin Color 

Consider the regularization strategies used in Angélica Dass’s "[humanae](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/4000-skin-colors-in-pantone-squares-1254683)", in which the artist has matched the skin colors of 4000 participants to corresponding Pantone colors. Also, compare this with "[Synecdoche](images/typologies/byron_kim_synecdoche.jpg)" by Byron Kim.

### Candice Breitz

Typologies can use *dynamic* media objects, not just static ones. Candice Breitz asked people to sing along with a favorite song (which they heard through discreet headphones), and then [synchronized video-recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYxeezPvnk) of their experiences:

### Algorithmic Acquisition: Cloud Face

Computer vision algorithms can be ideal tools for compiling collections for typologies. For example, [Shinseungback Kimyonghun's Cloud Face](http://ssbkyh.com/works/cloud_face/)

> is a collection of cloud images that are recognized as human faces by a face-detection algorithm. It is a result of machine’s vision error and they often look like faces to human eyes too. Humans, yet, know these are not actual faces. Humans rather imagine faces from the clouds. Here, the machine’s error and human imagination meet.

### Algorithmic Acquisition: The Face of TV

While an MFA student at CMU, [David Tinapple](http://davidtinapple.webflow.io/projects/the-face-of-tv) used a face tracker to calculate portraits of the average faces shown on different cable television channels:

### Algorithmic Acquisition: *5-Minute Shower*

Below are small fragments (details) of a photographic study of every water-droplet shed during a 5-minute shower, captured using a high-speed (1000fps) camera and extracted using custom software, by CMU Art/CS student Doug Fritz, 2007.

## Typologies Depicted Through Averaging

It is possible to get at something 'essential' by averaging collections of photographs depicting related subjects. (This form of statistical inquiry is a precursor to work with GANs and neural networks that we'll see later.)

Nancy Burson invented what we now call "morphing" while working as an artist-in-residence at MIT in the late '70s. One of her best-known works was a series of composites, which created mathematically weighted averages of well-known individuals. Of them, Vilém Flusser [has written](http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/first-and-second-beauty/): 

> *«‹Chimera› is an ancient word meaning composite fabulous beast: a goat with a lion’s head and a tail of serpents. One might thus be led to believe that the mythical Ancients knew how to calculate and compute, but one would be mistaken. The mythical chimaera was a collage, a patchwork. If Bellerophon, who fought the Chimaera heroically, had kicked it instead of fighting it heroically, its head would have rolled to one side and its tail to another. This is quite different from the newly emerging, ‹true› chimaera. One may kick Burson’s Big Brother as often as one likes, he will never disintegrate into Hitler, Mussolini and the others. [...] The new ‹true› chimeras are consistent, autonomous phenomena. This is the way with myths: as soon as they become real, they look different from what was expected.»* 

Nancy Burson, *[First and Second Beauty Composites](http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/first-and-second-beauty/)* (1982). *(Left: Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe. Right: Jane Fonda, Jacqueline Bisset, Diane Keaton, Brooke Shields, Meryl Streep)*:<br />![](images/image-averaging/burson-beauty-composites.jpg)

Burson later posted classified ads in an effort to solicit images of [*Guys who Look Like Jesus*](https://www.nancyburson.com/portfolio/G0000oCZbt_Xbvy4/I0000iQ4msZO2eoQ):<br />![Nancy Burson, *Guys who Look Like Jesus*](images/image-averaging/burson_jesus_guys.jpg) 

Jason Salavon became well known for working this way in the late 1990s. Befriending a department store photographer, he created averages of "[100 Special Moments](http://salavon.com/work/SpecialMoments/)" (1997): kids with Santa, newlyweds, etc.<br />![](images/image-averaging/datavis_salavon_santa_wedding.jpg)

Salavon has also created [averages of homes-for-sale](http://salavon.com/work/Homes/) (1999-2002) from classified advertisements in different metropolitan areas:<br />![](images/image-averaging/salavon_homes_for_sale.jpg)

### Collective Snapshots

The use of **online databases** of tagged images substantially expands our ability to learn about places, as they are seen by multitudes of people. 

![Corinne Vionnet's Photo Opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/master/docs/images/image-averaging/corinne-vionnet-photoopportunities.jpg)<br />
In her series "*Photo Opportunities*", artist [Corinne Vionnet](http://www.corinnevionnet.com/-photo-opportunities.html) works to create landscapes generated from *thousands* of tourist photos. She takes efforts to align them first. ([Additional article](http://petapixel.com/2013/10/23/photo-opportunities-interview-artist-corinne-vionnet/)) 

Catalan artist Pep Ventosa works similarly, averaging images of the Brooklyn Brige, and of New York City lamp-posts:<br />![Golden Gate Bridge](http://www.pepventosa.com/users/PV1062/images/PV10622164015.jpg)

### Collections Produced by Subtraction

Rather than accumulation and addition, collections can be produced by filtering and subtraction. 

Rutherford Chang blacked out everything but the faces on the front page of the New York Times:<br />![](images/typologies/datavis_rutherford_chang_nyt_det.jpg)

He produced a 'calendar' from one full month of front pages, providing a person-centered view of the news:<br />![](images/typologies/datavis_rutherford_chang_nyt.jpg)

Tim Hawkinson extracted just the numbers, in his altered found photograph, *Bleached Football Game* (1992):

![](images/typologies/hawkinson_bleached_football_game.jpg)

### Collections Presented In Time

While small multiples are generally ordered in space, they can also be ordered by time, as in this extreme [16-year time lapse by artist JK Keller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVAkxmZqNNE):<br />[![](images/typologies/selfies-JK-Keller.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVAkxmZqNNE)

Consider the following two projects by former CMU MFA student, [Cassandra C. Jones](http://www.cassandracjones.com), depicting 'distributed objects':

* *[Eventide](https://vimeo.com/84883569)* (2004) represents a single object -- the Sun -- constructed from hundreds of photos by different people. The images are not merely a spatially aligned collection; the full video shows a complete sunset, with the precise duration of an actual sunset.

[![](images/eventide.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/84883569)

* *[Car Fire](https://vimeo.com/84894920)* (2009) constructs a virtual, 'conceptual' object from many, similar, others. The contributing images are ordered rotationally.

### Minimum Inventory, Maximum Diversity Collections ("All Possible X")

Neolithic polyhedra (the five Platonic solids), Scotland, c. 2000 BC:<br />![](images/typologies/neolithic_polyhedra.jpg)

Michael Joaquin Grey, *Erosion Blocks* (1990):<br />![](images/typologies/grey_erosion_blocks.jpg)

A “[Minimum Inventory, Maximum Diversity](http://blog.wolfram.com/2009/03/25/minimum-inventory-maximum-diversity/)” system, a term coined by Peter Pearce in *Structure in Nature Is a Strategy for Design* (1978). Christopher Carlson writes that “a minimum inventory/maximum diversity system is a kit of modular parts and rules of assembly that gives you maximal design bang for your design-component buck. It’s a system that achieves a wide variety of effects from a small variety of parts. Nature excels at this game: every one of the many millions of natural proteins is assembled from an inventory of just 20 amino acids.”

All 20 possible combinations of 3 pairwise comparisons of 4 elements: <br />

![all-possible-combinations-of-20-three-pc-generators.png](images/typologies/all-possible-combinations-of-20-three-pc-generators.png)

The artwork *Variations of Incomplete Open Cubes* by Sol Lewitt (below left, 1974) and *Arc Forms* by Christopher Carlson (below right, 2009) illustrate the "Minimum Inventory, Maximum Diversity" principle. *Open Cubes* shows all possible forms of a cube with one or more missing edges. *Arc Forms* shows all possible combinations of semicircles joined at 3 connection points evenly distributed along a vertical line. 

![](images/typologies/maximuminventory.png)

Tauba Auerbach and Daniel E. Kelm produced the "[RGB Colorspace Atlas](https://www.thecollectiveloop.com/2013/01/book-of-colors-for-human-eyes.html)", a 3,632-page book that showcases all possible printable colors.
