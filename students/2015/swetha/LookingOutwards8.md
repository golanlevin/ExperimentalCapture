Looking Outwards 8:

Sputniko always does noteworthy work but this time she has worked with MIT to create this project she calls the ‘Impossible Baby’

Most of the existing documentation right now is in Japanese. From what I can understand, the project is fairly new so we cannot expect a normal documentation music video that Sputniko is so popular for. The Project is basically one that hopes to capture the children made by same sex marriage through genetics. Her research includes documentation of how this process of creating an artificial baby may be possible in the coming future and asks the viewer to judge whether these children should be created if given the opportunity exists. Is it ethical? Is it ‘playing god’? What if these children are abandoned into the foster system? Her documentation also follows the children of a same sex japanese couple and provides imagery of the family’s life together (it reads much like a stock photo one would find on the internet). Although Sputniko is not intending to actually create a process or system for creating artificial babies, she is trying to capture the social, political, and ethical ramifications of such a process.
She presents the reject in a very business-esque way because she wants the user to understand that the process is within the realm of possibility. Rather than critiquing science fiction, she is trying to incite a social conscience about science.
