2015 is the 125th year since Van Gogh's passing. Loving Vincent is a painted animation, actually, the world's "first feature length painted animation" according to the production company BreakThru Productions.

The project involved 30 painters, hand painting 56,800 frames from scratch, making a 80-minute movie in 2 years.

The movie itself is enchanting. Van Gogh's life narrated by his own creation. It feels like that the characters he made became his life observers and are telling his stories in his stead. The technical details are exquisite, and obvious paintstaking and time consuming.

One other approach I would have thought this could work is by doing these automatically. If we can collect all the works of Van Gogh, develop a machine learning algorithm that learns his every stroke and extract the features, we might be able to texture that same style to every other surface. In this case, we could just film people saying the same things and change that footage to Van Gogh's style. People might argue that doing all these by hand really shows our respect and admiration to the great artist, and they would be absolutely right. But such technique once existent could nevertheless have much wider application.
