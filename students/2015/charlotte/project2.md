## Instersect



[![](images/intersect_still.png)](https://vimeo.com/143492711)

To create a different awareness when watching a dance performance “Intersect” captures touch between two dancers. This is done by rendering their bodies spirit-like and wispy, except where the dancers touch. There a solid shape is made out of the intersection. 
This disembodiment bears a new aspect to the performance that focuses on the visceral intimacy.
