## War Flying


###Research
The definition of Wardriving from Wikipedia - 

"**Wardriving** is the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks by a person in a moving vehicle, using a portable computer, smartphone or personal digital assistant (PDA)."

The modes of travel listed for wardriving included: walking, jogging, biking & railing. 

It was missing flying!

Routers can be in higher places like the top floors of buildings and its strength would not reach the ground, or they could be placed in other locations that would be impossible to reach by any of the aforementioned techniques. 

So we did some research and found some other people that had the same idea, but it wasnt quite right:

###Past Works

**W.A.S.P.**

This guy was mande for Defcon 2010, and seems to be the only one of its kind. Since then there has been muliple innovations on UVAs. "The war-flying W.A.S.P. weighs about 13 pounds with a length of 76 inches and a wingspan of 67 inches. Rich said it has a flight time of approximately 30-45 minutes with a maximum estimated altitude of around 22,000 feet." So those are not your avg sized googly eyes. 

**From the [NSA](http://hackaday.com/2014/05/02/nsa-technology-goes-open-hardware/)**

This was released with a bunch of other highly classified files from the NSA. Its from a division called ANT (part of the NSA for making hardware), which was a cataloge of different equipment developed by ANT. This is called the SPARROW II system. Basically a WIFI sniffer on a drone, but it costs $6K


###Setup
- Phone for GPS
- Raspberry Pi for sniffing
- Drone (not shown because it is in repair)

###Presentation with a 3D
- Difference in light represents the difference in strength
- This is a rough draft

***update***
3d map is now ready for information input
