###Overview
The Eora 3D scanner is the first highly accurate 3D scanner for the general consumer market. It's an attachment for your phone
which attaches right to the side of the phone and uses the phones's camera to interpret a green light laser emmited from the 
attachment. An app is then able to interpret the data to create a fairly high quality 3D scan.

###Why it’s Exciting!
It's the first time I've seen a 3D scanning technology that actually looks like something you'd see in a Sci-fi movie. The laser
light used to scan the surfaces seems so engaging- maybe not for an significant technical benefits but definitely for it's
plain coolness. The amount of things smartphones can do these days is getting larger and larger and its about time smartphones 
are able to take high quality 3D captures of the world. It is also nice that this software is very user-friendly and intuitive allowing
more people easier access to the 3D capture world.

###Why it’s not as Exciting…
It is not as exciting because, well, there are many ways to 3D scan right now. The most accesible one for the consumer market is 
123D catch. This software and application is completely free and I would think taht the majority of casual 3D scanners are going to 
prefer the free software over the higher priced Eora scanner. However, this is a nice scanner to have around at the university level
or for more dedicated hobbyists.
