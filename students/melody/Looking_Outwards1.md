#Oil workers (from the Shell company of Nigeria) returning home from work, caught in torrential rain, 2013


David Claerbout combines traditional photographic media with 3D computer techniques to render new movement and meaning to an otherwise still portrait of a group of Nigerian men.

Claerbout successfully stirs discussion of time, progress, and poverty through his portrayal of these oil workers by animating the water in which they stand in to move a sluggish but sure pace, suggesting the indominatable ruth of oil companies. On the other hand, the near-unnoticeable rate at which the current flows is reminiscent of slow progress and is especially evocative in the context of the photo, as the subjects are primarily working men in a poverty-stricken nation.
Another particularly eerie aspect of the photo is the gaze of the subjects, who, while suspended in time, seem to be regarding the viewer with a collective expressionless gaze, rendering an unsettling and almost surreal effect. Additionally, the slow pan of the camera further contributes to the feeling of being suspended in time.
Because this piece is most effective when witnessed in person, its documentation would most successfully capture its enrapturing effect by not only preserving the entire image, but also projecting the slow movement of the water. Since it is nearly impossible to fulfill the latter without a close shot of the water (and thus compromising the effect of the entire photo), this piece is most powerful when viewed in person. The photo documentation does it no justice whatsoever.
