#Two Portraits

My project was a portrait of two friends: Abby Adams, a violinist, and Tanvi Bajpai, a synesthetic mathematician.

To begin, I selected an original, improvisational composition recorded by Abby and asked Tanvi to write down the numbers she "heard" as she listened to the piece. I then transcribed the numbers she recorded through a simple algorithm by first
interpreting the different sequences of numbers she wrote and matched them to the separate parts of the original composition (e.g main violin theme, bass, drums, etc.), and then passed them through the Musical Algorithms program (http://musicalgorithms.ewu.edu/algorithms.html) based on a select range.

*Musical Algorithms* is a simple interactive program in which users can input any random numbers of his/her choice (or select from well-known patterns, such as the Fibonacci Sequence), and "see" these numbers turned into notes. The program operates by taking the input numbers and dividing (or using modular division, depending on personal preference), and assigning those numbers to an adjustable range from 0-85 (based on keys on a keyboard). 

I recorded the resulting "notes" from the program
and wrote 6 different lines (one for each of the different parts in the original piece), using the syntax of Tanvi's numerical interpretation as a reference to rhythm. Abby then played the resulting sheet music while I recorded each part separately, which I then assembled again to create the final piece.

The final piece was nearly entirely different from the original composition, with perhaps only a few similarities shared in rhythm. I thought it was a fascinating portrait of feeling between two very distinct methods of representing emotion and expression.
