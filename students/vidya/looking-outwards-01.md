Data-Driven Interactive Quadrangulation

Here's a new method to improve the future of 3D Modeling. Artists will be able to control the flow of contours with just one line.This algorithm will then search the database for the best edgeflow pattern fitting that curvature. This piece of emerging technology is quite efficient for 3D Modelers. Being one myself,this technique can be very useful when it comes to reducing time on modeling and accuracy in edge flow. As modeling is becoming more automated with various research, its is becoming less of an art.I think an artist should understand edge flows and quadrangulation without assistance from algorithms.
