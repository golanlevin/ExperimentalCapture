# Pixillation and Stop-Motion Capture


*(From the excellent [Pixillation Vimeo album](https://vimeo.com/album/2343337) by Kina Grannis & Robert Morgan):*

> Pixillation is a non-traditional animation technique where live actors (people) are used as a frame-by-frame subject(s) in an animated film. A live actor(s) holds a pose while a frame is taken/captured, then they change their pose slightly before a successive frame/still is captured. This frame-by-frame capture is repeated until a complete movement has been represented from beginning to end. When the still frames are assembled and played back at speed (24 fps â€“ 30 fps), the illusion of movement is created. Pixillation is both physically and mentally demanding. Keys to a successful project are well choreographed movements, that clearly demonstrate animation principles, in addition to a creative concept or story that introduces the audience to something unusual, unexpected, or seemingly impossible in real life. Use of illusion fully exploits creative potential of this technique.
