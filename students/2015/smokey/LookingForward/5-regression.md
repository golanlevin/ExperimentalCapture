Video Regression

![Regression Analysis](images/regression.gif)

Regression Analysis is a technique applied to machine learning. A digital artist has applied it as a way to styalise video.

This project is more conceptually interesting to me that technically. The algorithm they are using (see: [random forrest regressor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) is certainly not designed to be used for video stylisation, but for a machine to be able to 'understand' (however the application of the algorithm means intends to pull meaning) computers. 

According to the creator, Samin Winiger, this process *could* be done in real time thanks to GPU processing, and would like to see a real time VR application. I completely agree.
