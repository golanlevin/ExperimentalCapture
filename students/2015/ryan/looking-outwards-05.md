## Looking Outwards #5: *Heartbeat* by Geoffrey Hicks (2010)

Geoffrey Hicks's *HeartBeat* is an installation that consists of over 150 suspended light bulbs that turn on and off in response to the heartbeat of a dancer performing underneath. It was exhibited in Oklahoma City. When a performance is not in progress, visitors can attach a heartrate monitor to themselves and see the lights respond to their pulse.

*Heartbeat* is an interesting opportunity to visualize otherwise imperceptible phenomena and to think about the biological and creative componetnts of life. When the dancer is performing, the viewer gains an insight they would not otherwise have into the physiology of the performer. The pattern the pulse takes when propagating through the bulbs mimics the propagation of a sound through space. The aesthetics of the installation are well executed. The use of a performer that combines athleticism with a creative performance is appropriate for this piece.

Hicks is not the first to use incandescent lights to reflect pulse in an interactive space. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Amac√©n de Corazonadas (Pulse Room) uses 300 suspended bulbs. Each row of bulbs plays the pulse of a previous visitor, which is advanced forward when new visitors use the interface.
