###About
Ever done something embarrassing? Been somewhere you regretted? Well, let me assure you, your fingerprints were all over the scene of the crime.

###Summary
We start from the oldest form of photography- traditional printmaking. Users take a clean print of their thumb using a 
traditional ink pad and paper. They then scan the print using a digital scanner at 600 dpi - a digital capture. Later, users 
bring the print into the “Thumb Prints” processing sketch where the program- using the free library OpenCv- captures and 
translatess the image yet again. Users can then explore and play with their thumb prints in a game that challenges them to 
trace their prints as closely as possible within a certain time period. As it is a race against the clock, the game experience is frustrating.. embarrassing even. In the end, users will receive a one-of-a-kind print as a .tiff file to serve as a reminder of this ordeal.

###Reflection
Through this project we hoped to collage different types of capture and play with the errors in each forms of capture. 
We were successful in that the end result is a compilation of different printing and capturing techniques on top of each 
other influenced by both computer and human error. However, we did have to bring our scope down from our previous idea 
which- was more exciting for us- due to our limited time. We originally wanted to create a maze from the thumbprint but 
quickly realized it would require much more work on algorithms and processing of the original thumb print. Had we succeeded 
in implementing our original idea, the gameplay of the program would be much more compelling.
