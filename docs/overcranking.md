# Overcranking (Slow-Motion)

### High-Speed Photography & Videography
*This page includes contributions by [Matt Gray](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/theatre/people/matt-gray/)*. 

Ordinary video is customarily 25 (Europe) or approximately 30 (USA) frames per second (fps). Slow-motion cinema, also known as *overcranking*, is achieved by using a special camera which can record events at higher frame rates, such as 1000fps. When this video is then played back at the usual frame rate, it appears slowed down. 

Some practical options available to our class are: 
* Modern iPhones can achieve 240 frames per second.
* We have an [Edgertronics](http://edgertronic.com/) high-speed camera, capable of up to 18,000 fps. This camera does 720p video at 700 fps. 
* We have a Casio Exilim Pro EX-F1 ($750-1000), which can record low-resolution video at 300, 600, and 1200 frames per-second. 
* Another option is the inexpensive Sony PS3-Eye USB webcam (less than $50). Using Chris Baker's addon for openFrameworks, the PS3 eye can achieve can record 320x240 video at frame rates of 60,120, 187, and (with some glitches) 205 fps, yielding up to a 8x slowdown.

Because the exposure time of each frame is so short, high-frame-rate cameras generally require a lot of light. A lighting kit or bright sunshine is essential for good results with slow-motion cameras.

1. Slow-motion as an analytic tool for "microexpressions"
  * Slow-motion is widely used for analyzing ballistics and other very short events ([gunshots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y9apnbI6GA), [impacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfDoQwIAaXg), etc.). However, it can also be used for analysis of ultra-fast facial expressions.

	* In Sam Taylor-Wood's [*Hysteria*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33PZhpay8gM) (1997), a woman displays extreme emotions in slow-motion. "There are no sounds, so the viewer cannot be certain whether she is moved by joy, despair or both." [Citation](http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2002/01/25/29597.html)

Each musician was filmed individually in several takes using a high-speed (300fps) camera and an extremely high definition (1 MHz) analog-to-digital audio recording setup. When played back at 30fps, total time is ~45 minutes.

![Julien Maire, Ordonner](images/julien_maire_1.jpg)

  * French new-media artist Julien Maire plays fun on the concept of slow-motion cinema in these elaborately conceived simulacra, which are not actually presented in slow-motion. In one live performance (*Ordonner*), he heaves "heavy-looking" cardboard boxes which are in reality filled with helium balloons; their slow, gentle tumble through the air is a near-perfect imitation of slowmo video. In Maire's *Double-Face* performance, a coin tossed in the air tumbles ever more slowly until it eventually comes to a rest in mid-air; in fact, the coin is controlled by a mechatronic suspension system with nearly invisible guy-wires.

### Some Really Really Fast Cameras

* [Phantom cameras](http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/) can achieve about 1.4 million fps. 
* [Spinning mirror systems](http://www.stanfordcomputeroptics.com/applications/physics/rotating-mirror-camera.html) can achieve 3 million fps. 
* This camera can capture neurons firing, at [100 billion frames per second](http://www.livescience.com/55296-high-speed-camera-captures-neurons-firing.html).
* This [trillion-fps camera from MIT](http://video.mit.edu/watch/visualizing-video-at-the-speed-of-light-one-trillion-frames-per-second-9742/) can capture the movement of light *as it travels*.

### Audio 

Special things happen to sound when it is slowed down *and* time-stretched. The best-known example of this is the "800% slower" Justin Bieber track, *[U Smile](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/800-slower-time-stretch)*. Note that the time-stretching preserves the original frequences of the audio, rather than causing the pitch to drop into the infrasonic range. 


Zach Poff has [Resources for Exploring Ultrasound](https://www.zachpoff.com/resources/exploring-ultrasound/). For example, Bioacoustics researchers and hobbyists use portable bat detectors to lower their pitch into the human hearing range in realtime.
