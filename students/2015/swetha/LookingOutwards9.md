The cremate bot is an experiment in trying to capture the feeling of death whether it be literal or figurative. The bot is basically an urn that could turn biomaterial that the user supplies into ashes that are meant somewhere. Furthermore the project records the amount of material given into the machine so that it lets you know what percent of ‘you’, is currently in the urn.

This provides a chance for people to kill, cremate, and honor a part of themselves.it actually reminds me a lot of tattoos because they are seen as a way to permanently change yourself 
; to commemorate who you once were and who you've become. This in a similar vein, is a static capture through Ashe of a certain aspect of yourself that more than wanting to kill you would like honor and put to rest. Most important in this capture, I feel is the idea of remembrance; ashes in and of themselves have an aspect of great importance, antique nests, and value. The only reason you would dispose of yourself in this way is to remember that part of you.
