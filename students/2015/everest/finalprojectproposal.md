*final project proposal*

a large box with opaque walls (inside but hidden, there is a constructed landscape of geometric plaster forms). outside of the box is a television and a four button controller (left, right, up, down). the television is displaying a noisy image of looming shapes. when the controller is pressed, the image shifts; it becomes clear that one is controlling a machine which is broadcasting to the television. from inside the box, a sound of tiny motors may be heard. 

this is a project about navigating hidden spaces through a mediator, and the shifts in personhood and scale that come with that mediation. we are maximizing tiny distances by removing a direct line of sight and replacing that sight with an invisible transmission. even though one is in the same room as the rover, the images become distant, alien. it is an a extraterrestrial rover, albeit one for an aquarium.
