# Looking Outwards 9: Gain Self-Calibration Procedure for Microphone Arrays

This Looking Outward reflects on the paper [Gain Self-Calibration Procedure for Microphone Arrays](LO9.pdf).

The research team created a new method for calibrating circular microphone arrays in real time \(without relying on a manual calibration process\).

One of the interesting aspects of this paper was that it didn't really propose a new algorithm or process to drastically alter the process of configuring a microphone array.  Instead, it simply re-defined assumptions which make it substantially easier to calibrate the microphones in real time.  Given the fact that all of the arrays were installed in meeting rooms, it would be interesting how the system performed under more challenging conditions such as a concert hall with reverberation.

As probably the shortest paper and bibliography I've read this semester, it was interesting seeing how concentrated the efforts in this area have been given the number of methods described in  section 1 of the paper.
