**final project - aquarium rover**

----

*the idea-*

a hidden landscape inside of an opaque box- the only way to see in is through a television monitor. one is able to explore the landscape through the image broadcast via a controlled rover.

this is a project about navigating hidden spaces through a mediator, and the shifts in personhood and scale that come with that mediation. there is an attempt at maximizing tiny distances by removing a direct line of sight and replacing that sight with an invisible transmission.

*the start-*

started with a rough version of the rover:

and work on paper:

the body of the rover is built onto two tiny hacked rc cars, which now move in tandem and provide a solid base for the rest of the equipment. the camera used is a tiny button-hole security camera, which is transmitting signal through a re-enginereed RF transmitter taken from a backup cam (the kind installed in trucks and cars). the whole apparatus is currently running off a 11.1 volt lipo battery, although a traditional 9 volt also works for short periods (about 20 minutes).

*the landscape-*

constructed out of geometric plaster forms, the landscape is intended to be both explorable and recombinatorial. because of the narrow field of view afforded by the rover, one may go past a shape one direction and be completely unable to place it arriving at another. likewise, static compositions seem to change and move depending on what is in the eye of the screen.

*for friday (to-do list!)-*

-distance effects (fog or dry ice?)

-joint compound on all of the edges

-highly specific lighting (point lights, or maybe a projector)

-more rooms (currently 2/4 are completed)
