###Overview
Color 3D printing is changing the scope of traditional stop motion animations by allowing animators a wider number of faces
and expressions by allowing them to create a larger number of puppets with skin pigmentation and freckles at exactly the right 
locations.

###What’s Going on?
3D printing is changing the scope and limitations of traditional stop motion animation. Stop motion animation produced by large 
companies are usually made with puppets that come with a plethora of different heads and other body parts that are switched 
every time the frame changes. There are a lot of parts to any one puppet just because of the sheer number of frames used 
for each pose or expression. This makes things difficult for puppet sculptors who must keep the body parts looking consistent 
through every iteration. This gets ridiculously tricky with things like freckles and blush- it’s impossible to be consistent with
detailed textures on skin. This makes it hard for stop motions to compete with 3D animated films which have grown more and 
more detailed. Powder 3D printing combined with color has made it possible for these puppeteers to make all the puppet faces 
in 3D software like maya adn simply print them out. They are able to print the skin color right on to the face so they can be 
sure it is accurate and consistent throughout all their pieces.

###Why it’s Exciting!

It’s always compelling to see a melding of two different types of media. I think it’s especially interesting in animation 
where there is often a large debate on digital vs traditional. Using 3D printing technology for puppet-making is an 
interesting use of technology as it is used in the backhands of the movie and not in the actual animation itself. It’s nice 
to see a large big-budget animation getting creative with their use of technology as it will inspire smaller animators to do 
the same.


###Why it’s not as Exciting…

I think the only people who can use this technology right now are big budget animations. 3D Printing is expensive itself for 
the plastic used in it and adding color and powder into it would make it that much more expensive. I think once color 3D 
printing becomes more affordable or accessible in universities and private companies, we can expect to see more experimentation
and  (probably) more interesting uses of color 3D printing to make traditional animations.
