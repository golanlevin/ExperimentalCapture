### Moving Cameras and Point of View

[Aydın Büyüktaş](http://www.aydinbuyuktas.com/), using drone photograpbhy, produces surreal 'folded' [landscapes](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/aydin-buyuktas-flatland-ii/) that seamlessly combine aerial and ground-level perspectives.

> I had the idea of a new astro time-lapse technique in which the camera is pointed right at the north star and mounted to a motorized pivot point directly lined up with the sensor so the camera is able to spin with the stars through the night. Sit back, relax and Ride the Sky.

Sometimes the camera is moving relative to the reference frame of gravity, but not to the apparent scene:

Here the camera is made to "move" in post-production, in order to produce an apparently stationary object.
