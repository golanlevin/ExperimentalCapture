Magic Leap is a start-up developing products in augmented and virtual reality.
It has secured the investment from Google and now has released some demos showing its products. It is predicted that the company will value over $4.5 billion.

The difference between what Magic Leap does and products like Microsoft Hololens is that it uses Light-Field Technology instead of stereoscopic 3D, so that it "actually beaming the signal directly into the retina itself". Magic Leap is said to have invested in studying the relationship between how objects are projected on the retina and how the signal are transfered to the brain and simulate that process with virtual reality.

While the effects are impressive, it is still unclear what the final prototype looks like. For instance, one demo video shows what appears to be a hologram of a whale jumping out of the ground in a gym with students viewing from all sides. In that video the audience do not appear to be wearing any device over their eyes. How that is achieved I can not speculate, but I am eager to see if it really does that when it comes out to the market.
