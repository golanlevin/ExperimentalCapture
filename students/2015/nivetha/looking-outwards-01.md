###Live2d

This is a technology I’ve been interested in for awhile and recently it seems this company has released a version of 
it accesible to the general public.

I’ve always been interested in the possibility to create 2D visuals in 3D. More importantly, I think it would 
be fascinating to be able to draw something in 2D and easily make it 3D with a few pictures or what have you 
(like 3D scanning a 2D drawing). Live2D seems to be a step in the right direction and can at least help game 
creators get more dynamic facial expressions without having to mess with the 3D model too much.

The demo video above shows that it is still not quite right - there are some moments I feel the character becomes 
rather uncanny. However, the technology is still pretty impressive and what makes this technology worthwhile to 
look at is that it is available to the general public.

The video here shows more detail in the usage of Live2D and sheds more light on how the technology 
can be applicable to modern gaming. Already, some games are beginning to use Live2D- the largest one right 
now seems to be fire emblem.

Anyway, I just find this interesting because turning 2D to 3D has been a fascination for me for awhile. Most of the 
time, textures on 3D models and different renderers can make 3D look 2D but its quite a different feet to make 2D 
look and work like 3D. 

However, the limitations of this projects are clear. If this project sets out to create a 3D character that looks and 
acts like a 2D animated character, it falls a bit short. It still moves with that smooth motion that 3D animation has 
and still looks computer generated. But it does solve some problems. It helps faces in games that emulate 2D art style 
look more real with a wider variety of motions. It helps games that are mostly 2D have small animations such as a 
character breathing or flipping their hair. 

This technology is still new so There hasn’t been much creative usage of this medium. Many people are just beginning 
to test and get comfortable with the technology. I think there is potential, though to get some interesting projects 
from this technology.
