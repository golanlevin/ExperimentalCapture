**Fighting ISIS with 3D modeling**

Conflict and war in the Middle East have not only had terribly detrimental effects on the population and landscape, but historical sites as well. Initiated by the currently (wrongfully) detained Syrian activist Bassel Khartabil, the New Palmyra is an ongoing project being maintained by a team of software engineers, artists, curators, historians, and archaeologists from all over the world, contributing code and models to the 3D model of the ancient Semitic city of Palmyra. A site of cultural significance, the original structures have been decimated by years of civil unrest in the region and cultural genocide by ISIS.

Recently, the project has unveiled a new open-source platform that allows the public to contribute to the project, bringing awareness to the plight of cultural destruction in Syria and Khartabil's wrongful detainment. The resulting models will be completely open source, available for future generations for creative or educational use.
