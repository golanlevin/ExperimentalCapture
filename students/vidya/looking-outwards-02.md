Looking Outwards

Since we are doing an interactive hologram piece for our project. I thought it would be cool to search up something along the lines of the project. So I found this cool  projection mapping which uses a projector and a 3D camera to replicate the effects of the glowing moon .I think the resulting installation is heavenly and surreal. This is also a kind of effect I would like to achieve with a hologram if we use a more ephemeral object. I think it would be great to show like glowing smoke or water through a hologram style projection.
