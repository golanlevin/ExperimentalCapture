# Project 2: A Person in Time

*Due Wednesday, October 21 at the beginning of class.*<br />


## The Assignment

*Using expanded capture techniques, acquire a digital impression of a person in time, and develop a virtual manifestation of this portrait or impression which reveals something unseen about this person (or people).*

To rephrase somewhat, this assignment asks you to "capture" (with various acquisition technologies) a real person in time, and then design a presentation of this recording in some technologized medium.

### What? 

**There is a spectrum of things** you might focus on, ranging from
* a person, considered as a still thing
* a person in time, "doing something" or in the act of "being"
* a movement

*We have an enormous range of motion capture technologies at our disposal, including at least 3 full-body mocap studios.*

For this assignment, it is strongly recommended that you develop your project by combining recordings from **two simultaneous data sources,** such as video plus some parallel data stream. Some possible examples (among others) include:

* Video plus GPS location (using an Arduino GPS shield)
* Video plus eye-tracking information (using the Eye Tribe)
* Video plus hand joint data (from a Leap controller)
* Video plus body skeleton data (from a Kinect) 
* Video plus breathing or pulse data (from an Arduino with sensors)
* RGBD point clouds plus thermal imaging
* Heartbeat (pulse) plus full-body motion capture
* Audio plus body skeleton data (from a Kinect) 
* LIDAR plus audio.....
* You may also use time-lapse and slow-motion approaches.....

### Inspiration: 

Consider integrating one or many of these creative constraints into your portrait:

* The viewer of the portrait may interactively influence the perspective.
* The portrait is synthesized from entirely found images that you did not take yourself.
* The portraitâ€™s final form is not an image, but rather a sculpture.
* Place a real person in an imaginary space.
* The person portrayed was never actually present in the environment depicted.

### Requirements and Constraints

* Your final project must be a virtual manifestation. Acceptable projects are: 
	* a real-time software executable (created, for example, in Unity3D, openFrameworks, Processing, three.js, etc.) (Note: *interactivity* is optional).
	* a video or computer-generated animation 
	* a computer-generated model or rendering 
* Regardless of any subsequent digital transformations you might apply, you must "capture" a real person, "moving", as the initial basis for your virtual manifestation.

### Considerations 

* Be mindful of form and content connection. How does your chosen medium or technique help illustrate something unique about  your subject, beyond what a normal photograph could? The environment, effects or geometry should be illustrative of their nature. 
* Consider other ways to incorporate your subject into the process or the result; interviews, collaboration etc. 
* Please collaborate with and earn the trust of your subject. Make a good faith effort to show them their portrait when it is complete. 
* Keep in mind that allowing you to represent a person is often an act of generosity.

### Details 

* **Create** a Markdown document called <code>project2.md</code> in your student folder. You will document your project in this file. 
* In this document, **write** a couple of paragraphs (150-250 words) about the experience of creating the piece. Critique your work: where do you feel you succeeded? Where do you feel you fell short of what you'd hoped to achieve? What did you learn? 
* *All* projects must be documented with at least one digital image at least 1600 pixels wide. 
* With the exception of still renderings, *all* projects will be documented through online video hosted on YouTube or Vimeo, and linked from the <code>project2.md</code> page. (Note, Markdown does not allow video embedding, so use the technique [described here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#videos).) Software executables must be documented with a screencaptured video.
* Optionally, you are invited to publish 3D files to sharing/hosting sites such as [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19276) or [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models/5bb11bc427eb49d7952fb857a1e3d98f).
* **Submit** your files (<code>project2.md</code>, various images, etc.) in the form of a pull request to this repository.
