### Summary
Starting "Things around me," I was interested in the experience of the world objects around me have. I was intereseted in their perception of the world from their stationary standpoint. I project used multiple 360 videos shot from the viewpoint of objects around my house to create this experience. Each object is one that I use often and, thus, objects that I should know well. Users Experience the peice through an ipad which they must move around to see the 360 video. They will first be presented with a library of videos from different viewpoints. After choosing a video, users will be allowed to view it on an ipad- moving around to interact with it. This physicallity of the interaction and the unqueness of the experience allows viewers to really put themselves into the experience and relate to these objects in another level.

### Potential VR 
 In the best case scenario, these videos will be available for viewers to watch using a google cardboard- they will be able to use Youtube’s new feature which allows 360 videos to be experienced in VR using compatible phones. Currently, the list of compatible phones that will allow this piece to be experienced in the way it was supposed to is small. However, more phones are projected to be able to use this technology and Apple seems to have plans to allow their phones to work with this technology. Until then, though, the piece is best viewed on a smart tablet like the iPad where viewers can move the iPad (viewport) around themselves to experience the piece. Moving the iPad gives a glimpses of the physicality this piece will ideally have with google cardboard.

### Reflection
A large amount of this project was trying to get the 360 camera to connect with my iPhone, trying to pretend there was no camera where I knew there was, and trying to find ways to use youtube’s new VR capabilities with the materials I could get my hands on. In the end, I had to settle for using an iPad, however, I’m confident the piece can be experienced in google cardboard in the near future as Google works to drive out it’s compatibility issues.
