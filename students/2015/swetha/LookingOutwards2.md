He composes his images in a painting like fashion so that as a set one almost forgets the technologies, work, and effort it takes to bring these images to a wider audience. It's as the saying goes, good work is seemingly effortless work. The precision of his shots are also noteworthy as well as the subject matters he chooses. Nothing is a particularly dangerous or interesting organism; most are plants, nuts, etc. They reason they become interesting to the average viewer is because of the work the artist has done in creating a microscopic view.

To create these captures, Nishinaga uses Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) technology.
