#### Concept

Our original inspiration for this project came from the Pepper's Ghost illusion that you can easily create with any LCD screen and clear plastic. We were especially influenced by this video on [How to Turn Your iPhone into a 3D Hologram](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/11780393/How-to-turn-your-phone-into-a-3D-hologram-projector.html). Of course, it's not an actual hologram, but it projects the iPad screen perpendicular to the viewer's line of vision to create an amazing suspended effect. There are a number of companies who have tried to capitalize on this concept such as [Youlalight](http://youlalight.com/en/3dpiramidforipad), however we wanted to take advantage of the affordable nature of its implementation, and also enrich the experience by adding the interactivity of an iPad.

So we decided to give my Piggy Bank a new life using this illusion. The Piggy Bank was the perfect choice because it was a childhood object, it involves a unique interaction, and it has personality. And since we wanted to give it a new life, we decided to play with its 3D mesh and give it new forms.

In conclusion, our project was pretty fun to implement despite the hiccups that come with using so many different platforms and software. If we were to revisit the project in the future, we would focus more on harnessing the interactions with animation controllers and generating the forms directly in Unity. We would also scan a variety of other objects to experiment with different mesh forms.

#### Process

Our process has several parts, involving many programs and machines. Here is the break down.

*3D Scan*
- 3D scan the subject using **123D Catch** for the iPad
- Reduce and clean the geometry using **Maya** and the **DynaMesh** feature in **ZBrush**

*Generate Forms with Maya*
- Generate new renditions of our piggy using **MEL scripting in Maya**
- Format their pivots and export the OBJs for **Unity**

*Implement Interactions in Unity*
- Implement touch interactions with 3D objects, including rotation and spawning
- Adjust the standard shader to give the right appearance
- Use the **Unity Remote** to debug the program in real time

*Build on iOS*
- Deploy the Unity build for an iPad 4 using **XCode7**, which thankfully allows developers to build on devices for free starting this year

*Construct the Pyramid*
- Calculate proportions of pyramid
- Laser cut on clear acrylic (prototype) and black-tinted acrylic
- Assemble with acrylic cement

*Other*
- Document the project in semi-dark settings
- Use the **Flicker Free** plugin for **Premiere Pro** because it's hard to record screens in the dark
