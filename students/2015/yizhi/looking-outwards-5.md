[HOW PHOTOSHOP HELPS NASA REVEAL THE UNSEEABLE](http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2015/09/how-photoshop-helps-nasa-reveal-the-unseeable.html)

This project shows the colorization of space photos.

NASA takes thousands of photos of the space, but because not all the lights in the universe are visible (indeed most of them arenâ€™t), NASA uses this special device to capture only a small range of lights on the spectrum. It takes thousands of these photos from different spectrum ranges, and later colorize them into human visible spectrums ranges. Then these photos are composited together to create the colorful space photos that should have been otherwise unseeable by human eyes.
The project itself if not technically difficult, but the idea is nevertheless interesting. Visualizing ultraviolet in blue and infrared in red however, does present the universe to common eyes in a way no less scientific.

Some way of improvement might be develope a camera that takes spatial photos and maps them to visible spectrum automatically so that no 20 hour post production is necessary.
