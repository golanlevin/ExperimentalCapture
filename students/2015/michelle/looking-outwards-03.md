Wobble Strings explores how CMOS sensor scans distorts and captures fast moving objects using the rolling-shutter effect. The effect can normally only be seen in a camera viewfinder or a PC screen, but the Wobble Strings team implemented the effect live and in real time. They used spatially divided stroboscopic projection to reproduce the effect by generating animation of sweep lines. To demonstrate their research, they projected onto a guitar play so that the motion of how the guitar string wobbles can be perceived in slow motion.

The presentation of the project was really well done, especially by choosing guitar strings as a subject. The speed of their sweep lines were matched with the pitch of the strings. In addition, they mapped textures to the projection that kind of paralleled the use of rolling-shutter speed as an artistic effect. Unfortunately, I think only one pitch can be the focus at any moment. However, I really like this simple approach of capturing something outside of human perception. I've seen this used with the visualization of sound vibrations, but I wonder if it can be applied to other super speed motions such as the fluttering of insect winds.
