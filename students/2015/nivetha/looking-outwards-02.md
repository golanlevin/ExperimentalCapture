### Smoothie-3D

Recently, I came across this piece of technology which blew my mind.  Usually, with any sort of 3D scanning you 
need a large amount of data to create the 3D scan. You need views of it from all sorts of angles- you need 
to really view it from every turn. 

However, this new technology called Smoothie-3D is a free online tool that lets you essentially ‘scan’ a 2D image
and create a 3D model from just one image. 

When I say ‘scan’ though, it is not as simple as that. Essentially, the program asks you to trace the object you 
are scanning and create elementary shapes and position these shapes into your desired figure. The video below does
a much better job of explainng:

* Here is an article about the software which is fairly informative and easy to follow: [article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&v=fbEHGUnpMxI)


Although this technology is not a ‘real’ 2d to 3d software it is extremely close- probably as close as we can get for now.
The fact that it is a free online program makes it even more desirable. I haven’t tried the software myself as the models 
it produces seems more fit for 3D printing rather than animation or other uses. Moreover, the texture is warped where it 
stretches and may not be the best for animating or demonstrations. Moreover, it only seems to be able to do perfectly 
symmetrical items from a side point of view. I have yet to see it used on anything non-symmetrical with a non-side point 
of view. However, the fact that it is accessible, simple to use, and effective as a 3D printing tool overshadows the rest, 
in my opinion. 

Anyway, in the end, I think the best thing about this project is it’s amazing accessibility to beginners.
