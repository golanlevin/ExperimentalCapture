this one week workshop (and series of projects) stemmed from the recognition that autonomous bots are rarely thought of as physically manifested objects. these scripts live their lives in digital and social spaces, and because their efforts are often accessible everywhere, it is difficult to imagine them in a specific 'there'. despite this, such bots do live physically in the world- whether it be on a server in a warehouse in rural utah, or in a raspberry pi in someone's bedroom. here, matthew plummer-fernandez is attempting to highlight the tangible home of such entities, and proposes that their housing- or, and he posits, botcave- is a powerful (and often overlooked) way to present data or interact with these entities in space. 

the projects ranged from a piggy-bank-computer-virus that threatened to post private content to social networks unless kept satisfied with quarters, to a pair of dueling racecars propelled forward with tweets including the tags #GOOD or #EVIL, to the Wifi Oracle, which cracked wifi passwords on a wheel-like device so one is able to copy the letters out on one's own computer.

these projects present an important dive into the housing of our contemporary digital tools, a subject that is often overlooked.
