**Art for the Blind**

A recent kickstarter campaign by the Unseen Art Project is an attempt by artists to 3D print 3D pieces of art for the benefit of blind audiences. The goal is to create 3D pieces of their original two dimensional counterparts so that individuals who cannot visually see the pieces can "look through touch", as well as museum patrons who would like to experience art in a new media. 

The project, while intriguing, brings to light certain obstacles, including the issue of transforming traditionally visually-expressed qualities such as color and lighting in a tangible form. The 3D printed pieces, despite being close replicase of the original paintings, could constitute as unique pieces themselves due to the number of differing features. While the current protoypes seem promising in their faithfulness to the original subjects, they are only able to mimic the composition and forms of such paintings, and specifically in artistic styles with definitive forms and outlines.
