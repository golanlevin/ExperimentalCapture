###'Feedback'

I really like this Interactive installation piece. Itâ€™s a very cool idea to see yourself on a projector and the duplication of the piece. Suddenly, the person is confronted with duplicate versions of himself. I think at one moment the person was surprised to see himself doing different actions simultaneously. I think this is a great interactive piece that should be show to a wider audience or take a video of a larger amount of people. I think the impact would be greater.
