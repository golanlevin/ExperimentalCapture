#Viktor by Jürg Lehni

Viktor by Jürg Lehni is a installation style piece consisting of a large blackboard wall and a drawing machine robot holding a piece of chalk. The device slowly draws diagrams and art . One such drawing was a diagram from "Silvio Ceccato’s La storia di un modello meccanico dell’uomo che traduce (“The story of a mechanical model of the man who translates”)"(1962) showing the linguistic potential of computers by drawing lines between words based on relationships in meaning. One of the most interesting ideas of this work is that Jürg states that Viktor is not attempting to be perfect or accurate like other robots, but rather to "have distinct character". This is a visually striking piece of art, but it doesn't do the best job at giving clues to the meaning of the diagrams and other art it draws. Viktor is the successor to a previous work by Jürg Lehni called Hektor. Hektor was also a wall drawing robot, but less refined and working with spray paint, not chalk. Drawing machines have been around for a very long time, and come in many shapes and sizes. The technical design of Viktor is high quality, but also very similar to many other drawing machines. Where Viktor stands out is in the framing of the machine as a character on it's own and in the drawings that it references.
