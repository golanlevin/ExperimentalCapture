**"This Book is a Camera: A functioning Pinhole Camera Inside a Pop-Up Book**

From ThisisColossal: http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/11/this-book-is-a-camera/

Artist Kelli Anderson created a bright pop up book whos contents flip open to become a fully functional camera obscura, complete with history and instructions for its use. The book comes with photo paper and creatively demonstrates the pre-modern methods of capturing images.
