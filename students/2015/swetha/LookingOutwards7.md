#Looking Outwards 7

This robot is probably very familiar to everyone: This DARPA robot is a robot that moves in animal-like ways. This is the first time that I realized they actually model the robot after cheetahs:

In this video, you can see that a Cheetah is used as reference for the creature. So much of our technology are self portraits so it stand to reason that this robot is something of a self portrait as well yet it aims to recreate the movement of a cheetah. Most of the videos documenting this creature are also shot outdoors as if placing the robot in the position of animals. 

Such a video can be seen here:

Capturing the movement of this animal with a robot and then placing the robot in the outdoors seems to replace the animal and is a basis for all sorts of sci fi films; terminator, tron, etc in which robots become replacements for organic material. This robot isnâ€™t accomplishing any singular purpose but to replicate natural movement. It is in essence a glorified camera for animal movement.
