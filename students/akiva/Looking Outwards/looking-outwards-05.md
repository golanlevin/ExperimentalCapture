#In the Eyes of the Animal by Marshmallow Laser Feast

Marshmallow Laser Feast created a VR experience comprised of 3D scans of a forest, meant to be viewed while in the real forest in the lake district. The scans were created using several capture devices including lidar scanners, CT scanners, and photogrammetry. The scans of the space, plant life and animal life are all mixed together in a beautiful portrait of the forest. All of the visuals are created using the VVVV software and views on Oculus Rift DK2s. The audio was created using Max MSP. I think that this is a fantastic use of VR technology and experimental capture. In the Eyes of the Animal finds a way of showing the audience a new perspective on their surroundings rather than escaping the. I love the nature found in the lake district, but I would also love to see similar projects all around the world.
