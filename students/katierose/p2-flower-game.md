flower game

this little project is half game and half drawing machine, made out of the guts of traditional arcade games (like asteroids and other space shooters). by taking a slice of a videogame space and duplicating it geometrically around a center point, one creates a kaledeoscopic structure out of player characters, enemies and barriers. the player controls many objects arranged around this center point- they all move in sync, with the same inputs.

as these objects are moved through space, they leave trails which are permanent until erased by an enemy or another moving element. this is also achieved by altering some fundamental structure of arcade games- rather than redrawing the background each frame, sprites permanently alter the world they move through.

these drawings are considered 'complete' when the player navigates the controllable characters to the edge of the game space. they are then saved as a jpg, and the drawing starts anew. 

i also developed a version that runs on mobile devices. this iteration uses gps locational data as wells as x, y, and z rotational data to control the objects on screen. these drawings are best made over distance; if left on and placed in a pocket while out for a walk, a complicated and intricate shape would emerge. 

made with p5.js and javascript.
