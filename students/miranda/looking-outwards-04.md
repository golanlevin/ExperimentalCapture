#Looking Outwards 04: NOSY Facetype

###NOSY, 2014

NOSY is a "facetype" (a play on "typeface") created by designer Rory Harnden. 

NOSY is an OpenType font that uses ligatures to create its faces. Originating from how letters would often run together in manuscripts, a ligature is when two letters are joined. In most programs that support typefaces with ligatures, the joined versions of a given combination of two letters are treated as a separate glyph. This conversion is what allows NOSY to convert the phrase "face1ears1mask3eyebrows2hair5beard3mouth5eyes1" into a face.

NOSY is pretty simple to use. After installing the font, go into any program that supports ligatures (Such as Word, Illustrator, etc. May require a quick Google search to determine if ligatures are on by default.). Each glyph is associated with a phrase (ex. "face1"), and the designated color of that phrase determines the color of the glyph. Type the phrase, pick your colors, and change the font to NOSY to see a face.

I am a huge sucker for plays-on-words, so I immediately fell in love with this neat little project. I very much enjoy the complexity that arises from combing NOSY's variety of simple shapes.

I had no idea you could do this with fonts (it's certainly a step up from WingDings), so after encountering NOSY I went on a bit of a learning exploration to understand how ligatures work. As for criticism, using NOSY outside of the live demo requires a bit of tinkering with various settings. The project would be much harder to understand if not for its live demo. 

Also, I feel NOSY raises ideas of merging written communication with facial communication. While NOSY itself requires a specific written construction, I wonder if something similar could be developed to generate expressions based off of the emotional content of longer texts.
