Voices of VR is a podcast that introduces new ways of understanding VR and how we may benefit from the rising technology. This episode was interesting since it highlights hw 360 videos (not really VR but close) can highlight experiences that are hard to share, understand, or communicate. The episode highlights one video in particular. Perspective: the Party.

The video walks through an ambiguous sequence that one can assume is what the real face of rape can look like; it isn’t violent and doesn’t follow a script like how the media tells us, but is instead quite, complicated, and confusing. The 360 video does a better job of explaining a narrative of this sort of sexual assault by allowing the user to feel compassion for the victim. Although I am not as unconvinced that a 360 video as opposed to a normal video or an immersive VR experience really brought anything significant to the story. In Later iterations, it may be interesting to be able to follow more than one experience in a 360 video; the party can have not just one main character but many and it is up to the user to decide which to pay attention to. Communicated sexual assault may not work on this platform but it is worth exploring to relate other experiences.
