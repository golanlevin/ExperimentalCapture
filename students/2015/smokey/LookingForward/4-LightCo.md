The light Co is a company releasing it's it's first consumer product soon, a camera built on android. It's no ordinary camera, the Light L16 camera is made up of 16 individual cameras of a variety of zoom levels. The images are "computationaly fused" to create a 52mb image. It can zoom between 35 and 150mm with an equivelent aperture of f/1.2 at every point in the field.

Similar to the Lytro's abilitiies, the L16 uses stereostopic depth data to create an editable depth map. In otherwords, because multiple lenses are used, one can tweak how the images are combined in "post" to adjust the aperture after the shot was taken. The camera also lets you adjust focus, but I remain skeptical as to how much control one could gain from this.

As for the user interface, the camera - built on android - has opted for a large touch screen and wi-fi capabilites. The camera plans to replace DSLR's in the hands of consumres - not professionals. Camera touchscreen UI's are notoriously frustrating, as one needs to look at the touchscreen to get feeback of what button is being pushed. This is frustrating for photographers, as when taking a photo, you generally want to be looking out at the photo or through a viewfinder, and letting your hands blindly adjust the settings as needed.
