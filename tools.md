### Miscellaneous Tools
				
* [R3DS Wrap	Mac/PC		Retopology tool](http://www.russian3dscanner.com/)	Very powerful tool for bypassing normal retopology workflows by aligning a simple 3D model (like one from MakeHuman) to a 3D scan. 
* [FaceGen	Windows		Head Modeller](http://www.facegen.com/)	Can take as few as two photos as input
* [MakeHuman	Mac/PC/Linux	Open Source	Tool for creating rigged 3D characters.](http://www.makehuman.org/)
* Lens			Bundled with Photoscan		This is a good tool for doing lens calibration in the case that you need metadata for photoscan. 
* [Fiji/ImageJ	PC/Mac/Linux	Open Source	Powerful Image Viewer/Processor](http://fiji.sc/Fiji) - This is a great tool that can create 3D from some unusual techniques - depth from defocus, image stacks etc. It's great for 'found data' projects using biomedical or other uncommon formats. Be sure to look around for plugins.
* [Helicon Focus	Mac/PC		Depth From Defocus](http://www.heliconsoft.com/heliconsoft-products/helicon-focus/)	Is designed for focus stacking, but can output depth maps.
