#A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style

Funny how in my last report I talked about Loving Vincent, a feature length full animation painting movie and how the process could be automated. I did a little research on that and it turned out that the algorithm that captures the essense of an artist's painting style has already been developed. The methods are described in this paper.

With neural network deep learning, the algorithm learns what is consistent throughout a painting, or in the art word, the artist's "style" and applies it to any painting or photograh. I actually found Kyle McDonald's work based using this algorithm, a video capturing New York City in Van Gogh's Starry Night:

This is not only fun and inspiring for new media artist, but can also provide us some insight of how the artists of certain styles and certain periods of time sees the world. The algorithm itself would provide us enough information about that might actually change how we view the history itself.
