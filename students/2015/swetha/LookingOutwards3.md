Disney research has created this screen that allows users to actually experience textures when he/she touches it. 
The experiment is still at it's infancy and the way they achieve these textures is through vibrations. They have developed a rig for models that also stores details of what sort of vibrations to emit when feeling the surface of the object. If you notice the documentation they give for the project, all of the screens are below the viewer and facing up. This tells me that this technology probably would not be very condusive for everyday use but may be a great addition for games or a specialized sort of app. This will allow for a new sensation to be experienced by the user and will allow for many different forms of gameplay and creativity to manifest. Perhaps also, capturing which vibrations are triggered (what paths of the screen users are stimulating) may open new doors for marketting, human capture and more. Not to mention this concept of vibrations may be applied to VR for a more realistic gaming experience.


##Tactus Technology

On the other side, we have the Tactus screen technology that mimics something of what disney research is doing. The screens that they make can actually rise up to give the feel of texture. As of now the technology is very primitive so it can only be applied to buttons. Still, it is interesting to think of buttons that can rise up from the screen when the user is interacting with it. This will make iPhones, tablets, tv, etc, more accessible to blind individuals, children, and more.
