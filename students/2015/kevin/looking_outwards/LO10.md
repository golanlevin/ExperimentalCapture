# Looking Outwards 10: Painting with Triangles

This Looking Outward reflects on the paper [Painting with Triangles](LO10.pdf).

The research team explored a new fusion of vector and rastor graphics, allowing for artists to use traditional painting interface which is then converted in real time into a triangle mesh.  This process allows raster looking and feeling graphics to have the small representation size and scalability of vector graphics.

This was such a compelling piece of research, I was left wondering what a full suite of tools, not just a paintbrush, based on these principles would look and operate like.  Would there be simple ways to algorithmically straighten and snap drawings through the mesh according to user commands?  Could image textures be mapped onto the painting's triangular mesh?

The researchers appear to have been compelled to bring what was emerging within post-processing of images sphere, into the real time interactive.  However, the large time delays detailed in the paper with increasing complexity make me wonder the practicality of such a system as truly interactive, and the work may end up receding into the same category as those in its bibliography.
