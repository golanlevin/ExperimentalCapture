# Looking Outwards 7: VIP: Finding Important People in Images

This Looking Outward reflects on the paper [VIP: Finding Important People in Images](LO7.pdf).

The researchers developed methods for identifying the most important individuals in an image by relying on various aspects of image quality and placement, as well as social dynamics and group relationships, while avoiding using facial recognition.  This method hopes to improve image2txt as well as the results returned when searching for photos of an individual.

One of the major assumptions I see in this work is the treatment of all photos as having the same goals for quality.  Given the proliferation of consumer cameras, and the divide between needing to index professional photos and videos for TV shows and movies, vs indexing photos taken on a smartphone, I wonder if a one size fits all approach is best.  Could the identification process be improved by further research into the salient aspects of these different breeds of photography?

Given the amount that the paper emphasized the human aspect of the process through the use of the Amazon mechanical turk et al, I'm surprised the bibliography doesn't contain more psychological and photographic research, as opposed to relying on primarily Computer Vision research.
