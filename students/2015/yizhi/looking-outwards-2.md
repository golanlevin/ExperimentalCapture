## Project : SteadXP Video Stablizer

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1091165875/steadxp-the-future-of-video-stabilization

This kickstarter project built a device that does video stabilization. The product is called SteadXP and it was developed by a team in Grenoble, France.

What’s special about this:

Video stabilization is a classic computer vision problem. What people usually do is to track a salient feature in a static image from the video and use it as an anchor point to track the turbulence trajectory and get rid of the jittering. This project is taking a shortcut which proves actually much more effective. In stead of taking the pain to find an anchor point afterwards, the device attached to the camera tracks the movement of the camera realtime. Later when connect to the software, it has a much more accurate turbulence trajectory data than if it were analyzed afterwards.

What might be improved to increase its worth:

Since the hardware part of this project is basically a movement tracker, and the software part is basic computer vision video stabilization, it is not hard for someone with a little bit hardware hacking skill to bypass this product and embed a movement tracking function in the camera itself. That way one does not have to carry an extra device for their camera and Gopro. In fact, I don’t see why the team doesn’t think about working on this aspect and perhaps connect to mobile phones as well. Since for a world where people try hard to fit everything on a phone, an add-on device for a camera is really redundant.
