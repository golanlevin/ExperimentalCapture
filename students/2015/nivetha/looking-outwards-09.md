###Overview

The PowerUp FPV is essentially a remote controlled paper airplane in which your spart phone is the remote. However, this isn't the 
most interesting thing about the PowerUp. The PowerUp also has a lense on the tip of it's nose that transmits video wirelessly
to the user's smartphone which they can throw in a google cardboard and experience as virtual reality. The plane's altitude and directions
are controlled with the user's head movement. The application also has a game mode in which users can turn off the virtual reality
aspects of the system and drive the plane using a normal interface on the phone. This project is a continuation of the PowerUp 3.0
whcih was essentially the same product but with no video feed from the paper plane.

###Why it’s Exciting!

Who doesn't want to fly? This kit is fun both in concept and in implementation. The virtual reality aspect of it is really interesting and could be applied
to all sort of new projects. The kit itself is quite compelling in it's own right but the applications of this plane is 
very compelling to think about.

###Why it’s not as Exciting…
I don't think the VR experience will be that great. And the creators seem to know it too as they have included a way to fly the plane
without using the VR system. The VR system, I imagine, will feel more jarring than anything because your eyes would see the video but your
body will still feel stationary. However, I think teh VR is still worth checking out. If it is a windy day out, perhaps you can trick
your body into thinking it is flying.
