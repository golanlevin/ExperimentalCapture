This project builds a device which is a sphere of LED lights. It is able to imitate lighting from all possible angles to the object in the center. And with the dataset acquired by filming the object within under viable time and illumination, scientists are able to build realistic models that imitates human movement and body through matched viewpoint and lighting.

The idea is novel and surprisingly easy to start with. If one were to capture a person running realistically through some fake settings, the best idea would be to capture every possible lighting and viewpoint. The device does exactly that, and with computer vision technology, people were able to build 3D models that is a complete double of the original and put it in any possible settings.

One possible fallback for this project is probably the cost versus the outcome. The device itself is a huge sphere of lights, with computers attached everywhere and arrays of cameras. The amount of data it generates is also huge. In this project, the scientists actually have to compress the images taken in order to accommodate that much data. And this I should think would lower the quality of the capture to some extent, which seems to be such a pity since it has gone to great length to obtain the most realistic capture.

The project does not stand alone, it was one of a series of ongoing projects. It is the Light stage 6 of all related projects. The projects starts with a relatively small sphere of lights and started by capturing static human face.  It then explores how to make animations based on the data obtained by the capture of the reflections of lights from human face. It went further on to reproduce live action compositing and color matching, and finally was able to produce what we see in this stage, a running man from every possible angle and illumination in a fake setting. The progress made was rather impressive and this novel technique can definitely become rather handy in film making and even military training. Itâ€™s a new approach to 3D model making and much much more realistic than the dominate approaches most film companies are using right now.
