**"Screens are Stealing your Soul"**

A new piece by French photographer Antoine Geiger entitled SUR-FAKE appears to be a series of screencaptures from a modern horror film. Subjects, all on their mobile devices, appear to have their face/essence sucked right into the screen with no apparent alarm. While the techniques employed in achieving the effect appears to be a straightforward blend effect straight out of photoshop, the effeffect is quite eerie nonetheless and looks pretty surreal.

Geiger seems to be making commentary on how present portable technology has become in daily life and how much of our attention it captures, so much so that it literally absorbs us. It makes for fascinating photos, and I'm sure pretty boring photographic subjects.
