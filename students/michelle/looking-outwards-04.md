The Art & Science of 3D Scan by Photogrammetry is more of a documentary about the 3D scanning, motorized rig installation created by Kwai Bun. From the video, it appears that he is using 12 DSLR cameras. There are four stands with three cameras each that rotate 360 degrees around the human in the center. Each set of three cameras captures top view, eye level, and bottom view, giving 180 degrees of camera angles for each sculpture. In addition, the way he presents each sculpture without textures is gorgeous and true to the medium he is using.

The reason why I was drawn to this project is because Kwai Bun repurposed the aesthetic of photogrammetry in a way that allowed the actors or models to directly control their output. In this way, his project truly captures a person in time. He also conducted this project in order to feed into a unique feature of his [Quantum Human](http://www.quantum-human.com/) Maya Plugin, which includes Automatic Human Modelling and Rigging from an Arbitrary Mesh. Overall, the software and hardware produced by Kwai Bun are very promising and fascinating to watch.
