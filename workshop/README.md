# Experimental Capture Workshop

### Computational & Expanded ███ography, <br/>Anderson Ranch, August 2018


[Golan Levin](http://flong.com) / [@golan](http://twitter.com/golan) <br />
A one-week workshop taught at Anderson Ranch, July 2016<br />

### Learning Objectives

This workshop introduces some experimental media practices that arise from using devices to "capture" the world. In particular, we are concerned with how we can understand and build representations of the world using devices that sense beyond the limits of human perception.
