"In Pieces" is an interactive web-based project created by designer Bryan James that features 30 of the world's most engendered species, all made out of triangles that morph and re-configure into each different species. To quote James, "The collection is a celebration of genic diversity and an attempting reminder of the beauty we are on the verge of losing as every moment passes."  

Not only is "In Pieces" visually appealing, it also shows that James has done his research. The project provides easy access to extensive information on each species, from sources of endangerment to population decline numbers, as well as links to a variety of conservation efforts. 

For example, when I clicked on Piece 14 -- African Penguin, I learned that the species suffered a steep decline only recently, with 40% of the population lost to the MV Treasure oil spill off the coast of South Africa in 2000.

Again, this is a really beautiful project and an incredibly strong piece of design. The subtle movement and color morphing animations on the animals themselves are a nice touch, and there's a certain thrill to watching the transitions. "In Pieces" has a clear message, showing the fragile nature of endangered species, and directing one to information on how to conserve them.
