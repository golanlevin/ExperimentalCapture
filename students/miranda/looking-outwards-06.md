"Live Texturing of Augmented Reality Characters from Colored Drawings", created by Disney Research Zurich, is an augmented reality project that seeks to update the coloring book experience for the digital age. When viewed through a consumer electronic device (i.e. anything that can run apps with a screen and a back-facing camera), a 3D model appears standing on the specialized coloring book page. As one fills in the coloring book page, the marks appear as a texture on the 3D model. From the available video, the program seems incredibly responsive, running at 12 frames per second and updating on a frame-by-frame basis to reflect changes to the drawing. 

The marker system for detecting which coloring book page is being displayed (and thus which 3D template to select) is very clever, using details around the page such as boarders to not only identify what's being shown, but also to anchor the 3D model to the page. 

I'm impressed by how the texturing algorithm extends a mere frontal colored image of the model into a full texture. However, there's still room for improvement, as seen with the elephant's trunk texture obscuring the seam of its shirt on its backside. 

This project is one of many to embrace the idea of augmented reality using markers that are day to day objects. I'm reminded a bit of "Ingress", a mobile game released in 2013 by developer Niantic Inc., where players use their phones to see and claim portals superimposed on various real-world landmarks. (Niantic Inc. is currently working on "Pokemon GO!" which will use a geographically-based system similar to "Ingress" for finding and catching Pokemon, with an emphasis family and group collaboration.) The border between the real and the imaged is getting thinner.
