#Cosmos by Semiconductor

Cosmos is a sculpture created by the Semiconductor group (Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt) located in the Alice Holt Forest, U.K. The sculpture is a physical representation of scientific data gathered in the area. The piece takes the form of a large wooden ball sitting on the forest floor. The surface of the ball is covered with wave forms generated by the scientific data sets. All the data sets relate to the natural world of the forest including weather and atmospheric conditions. One of the most impressive parts of this project is the documentation. Semiconductor has created a short (15 minuet) documentary about the creation process of Cosmos with video and narration from each stage of the creation process. This project is very visually striking and the core idea of melding sculpture, data, and the space the data is about. I think that Cosmos is missing the opportunity to make the waves show the viewer some information about the data. As it is the viewer may know that real data was used, but the meaning of that data is lost.
