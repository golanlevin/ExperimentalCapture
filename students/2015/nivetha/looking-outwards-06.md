###Overview
Formlabs employees Josh Foisey and Will Walker have made it easy to capture video of your skateboarding experience form the prospective of your skateboard. They have invented a new mount that, after much tests and broken peices, is durable enough to withstand the stresses of average skateboarding. The mount is 3D printed and attaches itself either on the wheels or on the board on an average skateboard to hold a goPro in place.

###Why it’s Exciting!
This project is a lot like the projects we've seen in class involving capturing video from a persepective of an unusual object. 
And it is intriquing for the same reasons. The perspective of a skaeboard is all-changing and provides new insight on the normal world we live in.
It's great that this group has released the project as an opensource file and specifically outline how to set up and use the mount making the project very 
accesible. As an opensource resource, it has the potential of inspiring many unique projects from the data it collects.

###Why it’s not as Exciting…
Well, it's not as exciting for a couple reasons. First, it's not really anything too new or mindblowing. It's just attaching a goPro to a skateboard to get video data.
It is falls short in that after they get the actual video, there is nothing really to be done with it. However, this is an opensource project
and something done for fun so I think these faults are forgivable and doen't make this any less of an fun and compelling project.
