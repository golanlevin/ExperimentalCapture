Created for The American Museum of Natural History, "The Power of Poison" uses a book as a projection surface to create an interactive experience. From Monkshood to Hemlock, the projected book charts the origin of various poisonous plants' names, uses, geographical locations, and historical significance. The audience can interact with the book by flipping its pages, thus changing the projection; and by touching certain parts of the projected image, which play videos.  

Although the exhibition has long since ended, a digital version of the interactive book is available. While not as striking as the large-scale projection, the information is clearly presented. My only gripe with the book itself is that some of the drawings featured in the videos are of inconsistent quality. 

I do wonder what kind of sensor was used in the physical instillation to sense hand position. My guess is a camera, with software keeping track of each page's interactive elements and visually deducing whether or not a hand is overlapping them. I think it is clever that elements of the book smoothly fade out ad in, masking any potential digital jitters due to fast page turning. Consequently, this also sets a rather leisurely pace for viewing. 

"The Power of Poison" 's projected book format reminds me of a piece called ["Book (2011)"](https://vimeo.com/45263989) by video-sculpture artist Peter Sarkisian, wherein he projects himself crawling around on a dictionary making changes. While not interactive, it showcases the power, versatility, and potential comedy of a book as a projection surface, as well as its viability as an alternative screen for theatrical performance.
