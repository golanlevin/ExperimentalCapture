#Icebegs in the Middle of Paris?

An artist along with an IceWatch team extracted glacial ice chunks form Greenland to bring to Paris for the Annual Climate conference hosted in Paris, France this year.

I think this is a great art piece to promote global awareness of melting of the glacial ice-caps. By placing these large chunks of ice in the heart of the city, there will be mor focus on it and there is so many wayst to interact with this art piece. Over time the ice will melt and would be cool to see a timelapse video of this piece!
