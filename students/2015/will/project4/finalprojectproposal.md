Final Project Proposal

_Martin Hilpoltsteiner's Recreating Movement_

For my final project, I'd like to continue exploring the concept of temporal stretching, which I had started in project 3 with slit-scanning. This time, however, I'd like the visualization to take a three-dimensional form, taking individual 2D frames from a video and arranging them in 3D space, inspired by [Martin Hilpoltsteiner's Recreating Movement](http://recreating-movement.com/documentation/introduction/). Throughout this process, I will explore the use of metadata (sound, color) from the individual frames to affect the resulting structure's form.
