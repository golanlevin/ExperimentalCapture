In this project, we sought to bring out the essence of classical still lives through a digital re-interpretation or capture of the original art work. In a sense, this was a project in which we collaged together all forms of found capture (the scan of the painting for instance) in order to create our own capture of the painting. In this case we choose Georgia o'Keeffe since her still lives have a very powerful connotation to the human body. We wanted to bring the painting to life by animating it with the human body. That is to say, we wanted to map motion capture onto the painting. The most obvious way to do this while also having a dialogue with the original intent behind O'Keeffe's flower still lives was to used motion that in some way hinted at female sexuality. Eventually, we decided that only one element will be animated in the scene; the blooming and closing of the flower will correspond to the opening and losing of a women's thighs.

##Our Process

We first had to build the flower using the original image as reference.

We then proceeded to clean up our motion capture data and map the movement of the legs to the blooming of each petal through set driven keys.

The results worked well. Please click below to see our video documentation.

This project will be strengthened by repetition. Although animating a single Oâ€™Keeffe may be interesting, we would have loved to animate many of her paintings so that through this repetition a sense of creation, meaning, conversation with the past, etc, is formed.
