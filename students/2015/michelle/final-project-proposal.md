## Final Project Proposal

### A Portrait Drawing in Space

For my final, I want to revisit my idea for a person in time where I use Agisoft Photoscan to construct a 3D drawing of a person. I have already experimented with replacing camera textures in Photoscan, so the methodology I will use is to photograph a subject from 40+ angles, building the mesh, and then replacing the photographs with hand-drawn renderings. I plan on choosing an object subject first and then working on a 3D portrait. I plan to display this as an interaction with the 3D model with flat shading, so each angle should look like the individual drawing.

Below is not a portrait of an actual person but an example sketch. My rendering style will probably not have any outlines but smoother shading.
