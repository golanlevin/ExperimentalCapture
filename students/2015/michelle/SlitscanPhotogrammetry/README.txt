Slitscanning for Photogrammetry
Created 11/15/15 by Michelle Ma

This folder contains the Processing script in Java for converting a series of videos into slit scans. You can switch between horizontal and vertical scans.

The data folder also contains examples of a slitscan from a stereo camera. The output is saved to the project in the form of "filename_frameRate_imageNumber.png"

If you use these scripts be sure to cite me!

Enjoy.
