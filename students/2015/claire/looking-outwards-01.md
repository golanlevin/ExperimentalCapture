I am very interested in 3D printing technology’s impact on the creation of prosthetics for children. Because of the recent strides in cost effective 3D printing and rapid prototyping, it has become clear that a prosthetic no longer needs to be almost as good as having the real thing. Instead, a new door is opening in body augmentation, and a new question can be asked of an individual: what do you want? 
In some cases, like the project I read about for todays class, children have benefited from a modular prosthetic, that grants them seemingly superhuman abilities in their particular fields of interest. For example Aidan Robinsion traded in his far-from-practical “cookie crusher” prosthetic hand for a modular prototype that allowed him to screw in extensions for a wii remote, a violin bow and silverware. The project, which came out of a San Francisco nonprofit called KIDmob, and the volunteers that worked with them were eager to create a platform that was cheap, durable and capable of infinite iterations. As Aidan dreams up new attachments that are beneficial or even just exciting, they can be rapidly produced and attached to the base of the prosthetic, which houses a metal rod and a screw. Almost like a drill bit, extensions can be exchanged for different tasks, and having a prosthetic is no longer at odds with having fun as a kid. 
I hope that future iterations of this project explore  the “superhuman" possibilities for children's prosthetics, rather than the functional side. I thinking being able to tell a kid who thought they were born with less than their peers, that they can now do things others can’t, is a really fantastic use of technology.
