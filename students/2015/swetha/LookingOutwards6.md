##Looking Outwards 6

The future of shopping aims to capture the items we want, present them to us in a way we want to see them and then sell them to us with as little work as possible on our end. 

Here is a rather terrifying prototype for what online clothes shopping is trying to do today:

This app is designed for women to test out their clothes, the fit of their clothes, and more before actually buying the items. I can see where this product is coming from: They are trying to create a dressing room you can access from your smartphone or tablet. However, the app feels more like a voyeuristic venue for men who can dress women as they please and pull or tighten their clothes to create sexual figures. The app does not stress the individual and instead creates a bland model woman that is meant to represent all women and although it has a simple model it has a very detailed system for seeing how your butt will look in pants. All in all, not a success.

Here is something that hits a bit closer to the mark:

Although it still calls for some level of audience engagement (the user cannot access it at home, it must be in store) it still takes out the step of actually having to try the clothes on first. However, unlike the other one it does not tell you how the fit of the clothes will actually feel so for things such as pants or tights we still do not have a comfortable solution of how to portray the fit without actually having the consumer try on the clothes.

This is a product which provides a virtual environment for the user to purchase their food. It reminds me of Clairâ€™s project to create a VR shopping isle. In this case, the technology works much better mostly because it is integrated with something we already know and use; a vending machine.

Overall the future of shopping is headed towards a consumer catering society and the technology used to capture products and bring them to consumers are the same ones we use to communicate our ideas. It may be helpful to explore these venues to see the success/failures and to either learn or be inspired.
