# Looking Outwards 3: Video Streaming Overview

This Looking Outward reflects on the paper [Video Streaming: Concepts, Algorithms, and Systems](LO3.pdf).

This paper was a survey of the current state of video streaming techniques compiled by hp in 2002.  The paper examines point-to-point, multicast, and broadcast communication paradigms, video compression techniques, error control and other fundamental challenges presented by attempting to stream video over lossy networks.

Although the paper is a little bit old at this point, many of the topics it addresses are still extremely relevant in modern video streaming environments.  One of the aspects that I wish the paper had explored more was emerging techniques, and some of the ongoing investigations into aspects like multicasting which are conceptually touched on, but not fleshed out.

Due to the survey nature of the paper, many of the sources that are cited in the bibliography are primary standards in nature, while this paper presents overal unifying theory that persits between standards.  I think as an introduction to the area, using this high level approach was extremely effective, and that the paper used its sources for enough concrete examples to bridge the theory/implementation gap nicely.
