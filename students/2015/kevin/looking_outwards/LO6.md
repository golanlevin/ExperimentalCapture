# Looking Outwards 6: High-Quality Streamable Free-Viewpoint Video

This Looking Outward reflects on the paper [High-Quality Streamable Free-Viewpoint Video](LO6.pdf).

The research team created a new pipeline for capturing, condensing and rendering the large amounts of data necessary for Free-Viewpoint Video \(video recordings in which the user can watch from any angle\) over a standard internet bandwidth stream.  This was accomplished through a process of blending information and mesh points from a variety of different sources and cameras, into a single prioritized mesh with i-frame like temporal video compression.

One of the major questions I'm left with after reading the paper is how the technology will be able to scale.  There are fairly tight constraints placed on the filming environment including fully green screened, controlled lighting and close proximity to achieve detail.  Will this sort of system be able to scale to a size at which people would be able to watch a football or soccer game from any perspective - or other instances in which being able to put the camera where it normally can't reach would be really compelling.


One of the interesting asects of the bibliographic and inspiring work for this project is how it not only built on diverse past projects, but utilized the advantages of all the different systems merged together, rather than trying to optimize a single system for all cases.
