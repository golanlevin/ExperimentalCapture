#Ultraviolet - Capturing the World with a UV Monochromatic Camera

###What is ultraviolet?

Ultraviolet is towards the end of the visible spectrum just past violet, hence the name. You've probably seen the term on sunscreen, [or from Thomas Leveritt's project where ultraviolet photography is used to show skin damage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BqrSAHbTc). 

Humans are trichromats, meaning our color vision is composed of three colors: red, blue, and yellow. Bees are also trichromats, but their three colors are blue, yellow, and ultraviolet. In contrast, birds are tetrachomats, they can see red, blue, yellow, and ultraviolet, giving them a wider range of color vision than humans have. (Not all animals have keen eyes. Dogs are dichromats, seeing only in blue and yellow. A red ball on green grass can be hard to find for a canine!) 

The human eye is capable of seeing ultraviolet if the lens is not present (the medical term for this condition is "aphakia"), [or  is surgically removed, as was the case with Alek Komarnitsky](http://www.komar.org/faq/colorado-cataract-surgery-crystalens/ultra-violet-color-glow/). For the most part, the world of ultraviolet is for the birds, bees, and a handful of other organisms.

###What was done?

UV video was taken of floral subjects. This was used to create 3D models in Agisoft Photoscan, with mixed success.

Most cameras have baked-in filters to eliminate UV light, so an analogue security camera (which was also monochromatic) was fitted with a UV lens was used instead. Throughout the process of this project, three different setups we used to convert the analog signal to a digital one. The first one involved a laptop, an intensity shuttle, and an electrical outlet; the second and third used a camcorder with mini DV tape and a rechargeable battery for the security camera (the first security camera got fried and had to be swapped out).

Because the camera was monochromatic, the following images are not accurate to how a bird would see the world, but rather a highlight of what looks different under UV light. (Color images were taken with a different camera for reference and comparison.)

Video was taken at Phipps conservatory, and later a few areas around the CMU campus.

###What was learned?
- How to use Agisoft Photoscan
- How to use basic functions in Blender
- How to use a tape deck
- How to *safely* power small electronics

Both yellow flowers appeared much darker under UV light!
