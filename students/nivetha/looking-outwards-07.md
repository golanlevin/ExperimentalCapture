###Overview
BitDrones is a project involving flying drones that allow users to shape a 3D environment. As shown in the video,
the drones are all controlled by a motion capture system using cameras similar to the ones used in our motion capture system. 
Each drone represents a level of the 3D model and the user is allowed to move each drone to alter the height or position of 
each block. The user cna also pick colors for the drone and rotate & scale their model. One drone, which includes a small
display, allows users to skype with a collaborator who can also alter the phsical drones remotely. After finishing tweeking
the 3D model, the drones will export the model into a file that can be opened using Unity 3D.

###Why it’s Exciting!
Creating a levitating display and allowing realtime manipulation of a 3D world feels like something out of a MArvel movie. 
Especially using drones rather than solely relying on the capture technology suggests something of intrigue in the world of 
the project. Though it is strictly 3D and virtual, it allows users to engage with somethig physical to manipulate the virtual 
which, I feel, is more intuitive that relying an just the virtual.

###Why it’s not so Exciting...
Obviously, right now, though the technology is impressive, the actual application of the work leaves much to be desired. 
They are only using 3 drones in the video to manipulate the 3D object. However, this 3D object in very simple. So simple, 
in fact, that it would be easier to manipulate it on teh computer with a mouse rather than using the BitDrone system. 
It seems this peice of technology needs much, much more work till it can be used with more advanced project. Also, considering 
each drone in the set in quite expensive, the whole system does not seem very reproducable or fit for normal research and 
modeling use.
