In a world where everything feels like it's been touched, manipulated by some human somewhere, it's refreshing to see something emerge purely from the natural order of the physical world. Especially if it looks like something that thing looks like something done by a human.

This footage shows a GoPro camera that accidentally fell out of a skydiving airplane before its owners could travel with it, to land in someone's ranch, where it was discovered eight months later.

What starts as a home recording of extreme sport turns into something much, much more extreme than falling towards Earth. As the camera tumbles through the air and the recorded image of earth is distorted, reality begins to bend. In the very beginning of the fall, the image spins out of control, yielding a chaotic, irrecognizable image of Earth being pulled and stretched every which way. The video -- our view through the eyes of the camera -- is screwed. Everything is hopeless. 

But just when you think that everything is done for, the recorded image begins to stabilize into something recognizable again. A pattern begins to emerge in the movement that is reminiscent of a film reel, and the ambient noise adds to the phyiscality of that experience. For a split second, you feels like there is a human manipulating all of this, giving a sense of order and control that wasn't there before. But the camera is clearly still in free fall as the ground becomes larger than the sky. Nevertheless, with the stabilized image, the chaos is over. We're grounded again. The feeling of which is further invoked when a beefy pig curiously sniffs at the grounded camera, attempting to fit the tough plastic and metal into its slimey jowls. If this camera survived the trip through that worm hole, it can survive anything.

The effect reminded me of the stargate scene of "2001: A Space Odyssey", which was filmed using a technique called *[Slit Scanning](https://vimeo.com/41747091)*. 

In particular, a "plane of exposure" is created when you capture "an infinity of focal distances", generated by filming an image behind a slit while moving the camera back and forth. In the case of the GoPro falling, though, it appears as if this effect was achieved when the camera's rotation aligned with the fps. All done effortlessly, with no special equipment. Moral of the story, nature is humbling, or humans are clever, or both.
