### National Geographic: Twins

> In January 2012, National Geographic published an article and portrait series that compared sets of identical twins. The photographer, Martin Schoeller, shot each set of twins in identical clothing, with the same lighting, and from the same angle. Both the article and photos sought to explore how and why twins differ despite sharing identical genetic makeup.

### We Are Not Dead

> Photographer Lalage Snow’s [*We Are Not Dead*](https://allthatsinteresting.com/4-amazing-contemporary-portrait-series) series visually depicts the state of mind soldiers found themselves in before, during, and after their operational tours in Afghanistan. Taken over a period of eight months, each individual was photographed on three separate occasions. The first photos were taken before heading to Afghanistan, the middle photographs were taken during the tour, and the final shots were taken once the subject had returned home.

### Toy Stories


For [*Toy Stories*](https://www.gabrielegalimberti.com/toy-stories/), over two years, photographer Gabriele Galimbert

> visited more than 50 countries and created colorful images of boys and girls in their homes and neighborhoods with their most prized possessions: their toys. From Texas to India, Malawi to China, Iceland, Morocco, and Fiji, I recorded the spontaneous and natural joy that unites kids despite their diverse backgrounds. Whether the child owns a veritable fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride that they have is moving, funny, and thought provoking.
