I'm a 3rd year BFA student. I'm interested in realtime graphics, computational geometry, 3D modeling, free and open source software, and experimental game development. Lately I've been working on gross projects where people are getting transformed or mutated somehow which you can see on my webiste and github down there ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ I do almost everything in openFrameworks.
