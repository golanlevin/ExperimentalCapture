### About
In order to document a landscape we wanted to document what we perceived to be an intimate experience when navigating the landscape. More specifically we set out to understand a landscape by documenting the pulse of the women that navigate it at night.

### Summary


To capture this data, we navigated an area that was somewhat familiar for the woman and invited her to walk home late at night, an experience that is familiar and necessary for many women. We wanted to contribute to an ongoing conversation about street harassment and violence against women and although we did not want to target street harassment itself we wanted to portray the constant guard one must maintain over their personage. As our subject walked, we monitored her heart beat with a pulse sensor that was connected to an arduino in her purse. Simultaneously, we used a 360 camera to document the experience so that the viewers can be immersed in the same environment as the subject and thus gain a better understanding of what she was stimulated by. 

In order to fully capture the experience, we experimented with other cameras as well including  GPS tracker to locate the individual in space, a timer in order to time the distance travelled within a specified time period and more, ultimately we were able to pick and choose the data that was useful to us.

### Reflection
Although we began with a specific goal to document the experience of a woman at night, the project shaped up to be more universal than that. Walking alone at night and feeling anxiety over your safety is a feeling everyone can relate to in some capacity. through this project, we were able to capture a performance given by the subject when alone at night; rather than feeling frightened when alone, the subject felt more anxiety when someone else could be seen (though in reality being alone is worse than being in a crowd). Although the anxiety did not necessarily equal fear; simply put, while alone at night our personal bubble is much wider than the day time and our performance reflects that. This makes public venues and other areas much more alarming.

The project transformed to one that documents an experience of a place through the performance one adopts to navigate the space. The project as it currently stands is very personal since it documents a single woman’s pulse. If given the opportunity, we would like to explore the subject of a public persona and an anxiety over public performances by researching different subjects to get an idea of what a collective experience would look like, this in and of itself will make this project acessable sable to a wider audience.
