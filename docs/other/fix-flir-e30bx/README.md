### Disabling the information overlay on the FLIR E30bx

The FLIR E30bx is a portable thermal camera, primarily intended for prosumers, which internally runs Windows CE. It has a reticule and FLIR logo burned into all images and video, which cannot be disabled from its control panel. These obscure nearly 10% of the camera's usable pixels. 

In a phone conversation with FLIR customer service, they informed me that they made it impossible to disable the information overlayâ€”in order to ensure that all of the YouTube videos uploaded by "ghost hunters" would include the FLIR logo. 

FLIR made a special configuration file that allows you to *temporarily* disable the image overlay. To configure the camera:

1. Download the attached files below and save them to the SD card.
2. Plug the SD card into the camera and select *Settings*, then the *Information* tab.
3. At the bottom of the window select "update firmware" and pick "Overlayer_off".
4. When the camera reboots the overlay should be off on the LCD screen and the composite video output.

Note that the scale may re-appear when saving and recalling JPEGs on the camera, in which case you will need to run the update again to turn off the overlay.

Here are the files:

* [Overlayer_OFF.fif](Overlayer_OFF.fif)
* [Overlayer_ON.fif](Overlayer_ON.fif)
* [eFLIRInstall.exe](eFLIRInstall.exe)
