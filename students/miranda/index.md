### About Me

I have a strong interest in biological subjects, from the beauty of birds to the depths of disease, and I use these elements of life to create fantastic creatures, new worlds, and the occasional thoughtful experience. A sense of humor is always welcome.

I'm also interested in the intersection between production management and creative vision, and am always excited to explore new methods of animation to understand differences in production requirements and visual styles.

Remember: Birds are the best. Pigeons especially.
