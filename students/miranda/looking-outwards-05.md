A Moiré Pattern is a secondary visual interference effect created when two planes of parallel lines, each with a different angle, are superimposed on to each other. 

Designer Andrea Minini applies this phenomenon in her "Animals in Moiré" series, using parallel lines and their intersections to create volumetric shapes with distinctive silhouettes. 

I'm awed by how evocative Manini's animal forms are. I'm especially fond of Series 3, where each creature is a blend of two painstakingly curved paths (whereas the other series often use more than two paths for each animal's blend).

When I initially viewed this project, I thought that each individual parallel line was laid out by hand. However, at the end of each series, Minini shows the paths that were used in combination with Adobe Illustrator's "blend" function to generate the parallel lines. 

(And now I can't stop experimenting with the blend function.)
