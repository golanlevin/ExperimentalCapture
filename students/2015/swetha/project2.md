#Project 2: Smile

### About

Our goal of this second project was to explore the paintings of women and incorporate interactivity of a persons smile. This engages the viewer in order to engage in a performance while at the same time viewing the performance created by the pice. In time it is unclearwho influencing who, the viewer on the painting or the painting on the viewer? This process on engaging in a smile and forcing a smile illustrates the artificiallity of the gesture especially in conjunction with the women we have chosen to perform.

### Reflection
Ladies such as the Mona Lisa or Ingres' Odalesque are layered not only by paint but by the male gaze. It speaks to art history that most of the history we do remember are those created by white male artists while exloiting the bodies, talents, and stories of those less fortunate. In an attempt to converse with the past, we have contineud the conversation here by trying to understand why women seemingly do not have autonomy over their own body; even a smile can be demanded by anyone she approuches on the streets. 

### Video
Many of our users enjoyed this project and engaged wonderfully with the paintings that were framed and on the wall as if they were in a gallery. Many people did 'perform' with the piece and in turn the piece performed for them.
