#Project I: A nostalgic item


My project is inspired by my friend's memories of seeing the unwanted Almond Joys at the bottom of the candy jar after Halloween.
I chose this particularly moment to capture because I associate the candy bars as treats that children don't seem to particularly like, but are quite popular among adults.
For me, this seems to represent a quintessential part of childhood: hating candy with nuts and dressing up for Trick-or-Treating. The final model was rendered in Maya, but 
the original candy bar itself was a compiled photoscan model of an actual candy bar, rendered through the Agisoft PhotoScan program with 160 photos shot on a Nikon D90.
The pumpkin model is not mine, but a free open-source model found on TurboSquid.

Ideally, my project would have allowed the audience to experience the sensation of being inside the pumpkin jar next to the candy bar, as if both models were life-sized (or rather, you were shrunken)..
However, the actual product was much smaller, but retained a similar concept. While the surface of the Almond Joy seems to retain an impressive amount of detail,
I failed to capture enough photos of the bottom, where it touched the surface, and consequently the model has rough edges and pixelated. While it lends itself slightly
to the intentionally battered condition of the candy bar, it detracts from the realism of the piece, especially given the polished look of the pumpkin. Additionally,
further work on lighting and composition may have benefitted the presentation of the piece.
